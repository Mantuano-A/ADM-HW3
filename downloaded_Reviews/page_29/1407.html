    There are few anime as equally enjoyable as they are remarkable. And there are fewer still as thoroughly pleasant as Sunrise&#039;s latest foray into the world of school idols. <br />
<br />
Love Live: Nijigasaki is a wholesome reminder of why I enjoy anime, and of why the slice-of-life genre is so captivating.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, after the middling and sometimes frustrating experience that was Sunshine, I wasn&#039;t too sure what to expect from this year&#039;s offering of Love Live. While I was a big fan of the original series (Nico is my favourite character in all of anime), Sunshine missed the mark in many regards. It forgot what made Love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369973">
        Live so special in the first place— charming characters and cute slice-of-life— and decided instead to replace it with unhappy vibes and drama in excess. Sunshine was always walking in the original&#039;s shadows, with abundant references to Muse, and of days gone by. <br />
<br />
The great news is that, by bringing the series back to its roots, Nijigasaki firmly stands on its own two feet. It is comprised solely of the franchise&#039;s best elements, and highlights the reasons so many people fell in love with Love Live all those years ago. And, with a few important changes and some new layers of complexity, I believe that it is legitimately superior to the original. Love Live&#039;s third outing is its best yet. <br />
<br />
A large part of what makes Nijigasaki such a pleasure to watch is that it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously. The tone here is far more light-hearted and slice-of-life focused than previous, which is when Love Live had always shined the most, from my perspective. While there is still a degree of drama, it is used sparingly, and in a wholesome and heartwarming manner, with the conclusion to the conflict almost invariably resulting in a smile or even a big stupid grin. If you&#039;re the type of person who watches anime primarily for fun, I would say there are not many anime that do it better than Nijigasaki. If you&#039;re not so much a seeker of fun, and instead have a preference for the dark and violent and so forth... well, you&#039;ve found yourself in the wrong place, I&#039;m afraid.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always found it admirable how Love Live manages to develop large casts of characters in such a concise amount of episodes, and Nijigasaki is the best example of this to date. It bumps the size of the main cast from nine to ten, and rather than the characterization taking a hit as a result, to the contrary, it is actually an improvement over previous seasons. Each of the girls, no matter how boring or forgettable their design may initially suggest, receive at least one full episode developing their character in a meaningful way, giving ample reason for you to care about them. Contrast this with Sunshine, where I remember Saint Snow, the darn rival group, more than the actual main cast, and it is a world of difference in quality. Even the original series had some characters I felt were underdeveloped (Nozomi in particular), but such is scarcely the case here. <br />
<br />
The best example of character development done right is with Rina&#039;s episode. Personally, and I am sure many felt the same way initially, her character design elicited a sigh and rolled eyes. Her face being covered by a computer monitor, complete with kaomoji and other electronic expressions, felt very much like an unabashed attempt to bank off on the V-Tuber craze of today. But Rina&#039;s episode actually creates a valid reason for her possessing this quirk. It makes sense in the context of the anime, and it genuinely makes you feel happy for her in how she has found a way to confront her fears. Without this episode, she would be another Yohane— one-note and defined by a single gimmick— but with it, she has earned her place as a (relatively) believable and dynamic character.<br />
<br />
My personal favourites are Emma and Yuu. While there isn&#039;t anything too noteworthy going on with Emma as a character, she is adorable as all hell, as well as being from my favourite country (Switzerland). It is not often that westerners take the role of a main character in anime, and if they do, they are often either half-Japanese or a caricature with blonde hair and broken Japanese. But Emma is just a normal girl, treated no different than any of the other girls. This is laudable on Sunrise&#039;s part, as it demonstrates that they are more broad-minded and accepting of other cultures than most studios. It is the little details such as these which make the Nijigasaki girls so appealing.<br />
<br />
Of course, with it now being the third full Love Live series, it does follow a formula that most fans have grown accustomed to. But where the first two series spent the majority of their first seasons merely building up and assembling the idol club, Nijigasaki is done with this in its first few episodes, and swiftly moves on to character development and other matters. The only aspect I wish were different was that, maybe, this time around, the girls could have all started together from the first year of high school. I always thought it was a shame that Love Live had to end after a single year of story, and would much prefer to see a full three years played out instead. This is especially true in the case of Nijigasaki, as the cast is so vibrant and exciting that the thought of it ending after two seasons (provided we are even lucky enough to get that far) just doesn&#039;t sit right. But, I suppose, it is always better to end on a high note than to risk meandering about.<br />
<br />
There are considerably strong yuri themes within Nijigasaki. Unlike the other Love Live series, and most slice-of-life in general, it doesn&#039;t exist merely as a suggestion or as fanservice, but as something more sober and markedly human. One of the main characters is genuinely— that is, objectively—in love with one of the others. While this initially comes off as a bit of a shock when it is revealed, especially with it occurring so late into the season, it is handled in a surprisingly mature manner, and ends with a hell of an emotional closer. While my first thoughts were &quot;Oh no...&quot; when I realized things were going down the oft-trodden yuri path, the events of these two episodes earned my support, and this comes from someone who isn&#039;t even a fan of yuri. Sure, hell, I&#039;ll even cheer the two of them on, and hope that everything works out between them in the end.<br />
<br />
This yuri romance also adds a new layer of complexity to the story. Though I was already enamored with the anime by this point, it went above and beyond, taking a large risk that could very well have sabotaged my enjoyment and appreciation of the anime. But it is a risk that paid off, and I am interested in seeing where this romantic substory arrives at in the second season. The events of these two episodes do steal the focus away from what was otherwise a very slice-of-life centric anime, however, which may not be to everyone&#039;s tastes. But as long as Nijigasaki balances the two, and doesn&#039;t let the romance overtake the slice-of-life, then I believe the two aspects can peacefully co-exist and compliment one another.<br />
<br />
Love Live: Nijigasaki is a delightful and remarkable experience throughout. It is some of the most fun I have had watching an anime in... well, if not just a long time, then perhaps ever. If you enjoy slice-of-life anime to any extent, then, even if you have watched Love Live in the past but were irked for some reason or another, I would strongly urge you to give Nijigasaki a chance as it is a different beast entirely. This isn&#039;t just an anime for Love Live fans, or idol fans— it is a love letter to slice-of-life fans as a whole. <br />
<br />
In a lot of ways, Nijigasaki feels like the successor to K-ON (complete with its own Azusa equivalent), to which I feel like Nijigasaki has firmly surpassed. Its slice-of-life moments are more fun. Its music is more charming. Its characters are more compelling. Hell, it even handles yuri better. <br />
<br />
So where does that leave me, as someone whose favourite anime, for several years, was K-ON? <br />
<br />
While the second season still remains an unknown entity, Love Live: Nijigasaki, in my opinion, is poised to be one of the most lovable slice-of-life anime in over a decade.

    “The tiny melodies blend together (Our Colors)<br />
Let’s paint this arch, now. It resonates throughout the city (reaching for far blue sky!)” - lyrics from Nijiiro Passions!<br />
<br />
This show came as quite the pleasant surprise. Given the nature of spinoffs, it’s not unusual to believe that they rarely ever live up to or exceed the quality of their original counterparts and tend to fall short. But that is not the case here. Along with having several noteworthy changes and improvements, this installment to the Love Live franchise came in as something incredibly refreshing and serves as an excellent starting point for the girls of Nijigasaki.<br />
<br />
As someone who’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369974">
        seen the previous Love Live shows, I had some anticipation going into this. The original laid the groundwork for school idols thanks to the influence of μ&#039;s and while Sunshine shared many similarities in its story and structure, there were certain aspects about Aqours that were able to stand out. Naturally the prospect of another entry got me interested in wanting to see how it would stack up. There were some mixed feelings when seeing the change in art style but upon watching the first episode, those worries were quickly put to rest. This show has not only been able to meet my expectations but somehow managed to surpass them. THIS is how you do a spinoff.<br />
<br />
Love Live Nijigasaki is the third animated series in the franchise following the previous titles School Idol Project and Sunshine. Though unlike the latter, which sought to follow closely behind the footsteps of the original, this entry has its own separate story with no callbacks to past shows or idol groups which is a breath of fresh air. It shows that the series is willing to be innovative with trying new ideas instead of going for more repetition which already makes this show feel more distinct. One criticism that many had with regards to Sunshine was how closely it tied itself to the original despite being its successor. As a result, it ended up following many similar story beats such as the school closure plot point all while drawing constant mention and praise to the previous group: μ&#039;s. Nijigasaki on the other hand, sets itself apart by beginning with what I would say is a stronger and more impressive start than either of those two shows.<br />
<br />
Instead of starting out with trying to become school idols in order to prevent their school from shutting down, this time it&#039;s finding out why the idol group that was already established in their own school decided to disband. With this change, it allows for the show to focus more on exploring the different aspects about being an idol such as expression and being able to connect with fans rather than having a constant worry over our heads (Besides, this school is so large and robust anyway that it doesn’t need to worry about closing its doors). It eases us into the mindset of the girls and what being a school idol means for each of them whilst providing meaningful characterization instead of having them simply become one because of an outside threat. This is helped by the less arduous process of recruiting members as many of them were already part of a smaller group. This also allowed the show to feel more grounded with its story and characters as well as its handle on drama. Each of them is presented with the question of what they want to invoke to their audience which provides for some variety. All of them have different answers yet none of them are incorrect as the appeal of idols vary from person to person. Compared to the more ambitious starts of the previous shows, this story starts out as more simple and intimate with wholesome character interactions between the two main leads Ayumu and Yuu as well as a brief glimpse of the other girls. After being inspired by their first performance, which was done by an idol from their own school rather than another, they seek to understand what caused the idol club to disband and try to reestablish it. Later on it becomes about how each girl in the show will try to stand out as individuals as they strive to become school idols. Understanding other people’s viewpoints, being honest with oneself, and accepting the different sides of your identity are all obstacles they must face in order to get there. While the lack of a familiar looming threat such as school closure did cause the show to feel more open ended and lighthearted overall given there’s less stakes involved, it also allowed for some flexibility as we steer away from the somewhat tired narrative plot point giving Nijigasaki its own unique flavor which many may find to be a welcome change.<br />
<br />
The show instead focuses most of its attention purely on character development and with it comes the concept of solo idols which was interesting to see as it adds a new dynamic to the series and to the way live performances work. Nijigasaki is putting more emphasis on the individual, with each girl having their own color that corresponds to them, instead of the group which results in them not actually having a group name like in the other entries. While the show does fall into a formulaic rhythm with each episode focusing on a different girl who would inevitably get their own song at the end, repetition doesn’t necessarily mean bad here as it gives us something to look forward to. This is mostly because each episode feels distinct from one another being able to stand on its own merit with each character having their own problems unique to them making it interesting to see how it unfolds. They all get a chance to shine and develop this season which is something Love Live hasn’t done before. One of the biggest flaws with past entries was that there was not enough time spent fleshing out all the characters by the time the plot started rolling along. With such a large cast, there would usually only be a few characters who get their own episodes per season leaving the rest of the cast feeling both underutilized and underdeveloped, but here they all do.<br />
<br />
Another interesting change to the series are the visuals. How does it compare?<br />
<br />
Well to put it simply: it’s utterly gorgeous. Love Live has maintained a similar look for its first two installments, but here the art style is distinctly different especially in terms of the character designs which come off as less shiny but more vibrantly colored and crisp. Some of the background art coupled with the lighting in this show are absolutely superb and exceptionally detailed making some scenes really pop out especially during the performances. I was particularly awed by the setpieces used during some of the songs which all have a strikingly rich color palette like Ayumu’s glorious pink stage. While the general look of previous entries are fantastic in their own right (not to mention that I have a strong fondness towards it), the style chosen for Nijigasaki works surprisingly well especially with the CG. Studio Sunrise, having made the previous Love Live shows, truly stepped up in quality for this one. There’s no jarring CG, no awkward movement...it’s clean, smooth, and gorgeous. The CG in this franchise has sure come a long way and now it is some of the best I’ve seen compared to most anime out there coupling amazingly well with the 2D. There’s some incredibly stunning and fluid animation and several unique visual effects that are a first for this franchise as evident in the first song of the show: CHASE! with its interesting but effective use of fire effects as well as many others. The series made some notable improvements here.<br />
<br />
With that said, Love Live is not a show that will impress you with having complex ideas or a deep intricate narrative. It has a simple and fairly straightforward story but more importantly, it is a character driven show first and foremost with the aim of eventually becoming school idols in order to achieve their end goal. If you don’t like the girls, then you probably won’t like the show. As for me...there was not a single character that I disliked or found underwhelming. Even the side characters, which mostly consist of fangirls that the main cast garnered over time, eventually became a welcome and benevolent presence whenever they were on screen. It can be a difficult task having to adjust to a completely new cast of characters if you already have an attachment to either, both, or even neither of the previous groups. However, I found it rather easy to get invested in the cast of Nijigasaki. Naturally when you find one girl you like in the group, you want to find reasons to care about the others and the show does exactly that. It does a fine job of portraying them in a more subtle and natural way with relatable issues which made the girls here endearing and fun to watch without being overly obnoxious or unlikable and not feeling like shallow characters. They have some depth to their personalities and have more going on with them than meets the eye instead of merely identifying with one particular character trait or cliche. No one is constantly spouting deadpan one liners even if they were somewhat cute or comedic before. But that’s not to say the show isn’t without its humor. The funny moments can be utterly hilarious with the characters being fun and goofy with playful banter whether that be hanging out in the club room or working hard on becoming school idols. Coupled with good dialogue, interactions are unique and quirky without feeling overdone and this leads to the show having a smooth and energetic pacing throughout which complements well with the lighthearted tone. The voice actresses really did a great job in bringing these characters to life adding a bit more detail and personality to them such as the subtle playfulness in Kanata’s voice when she’s sleeping or the little mumbles and outbursts from Kasumi whenever she’s feeling frustrated.<br />
<br />
Handling of character drama has shown great improvement compared to previous first seasons as they feel genuine and built up with resolutions that feel more down to earth while not being forced down my throat with excessive melodrama or unnatural reactions. But it’s not smooth sailing all the way through as the conflict in the last few episodes felt uneven at times and a bit out of place given how far things went which clashed with the consistently toned down nature of the rest of the show. While it did provide some interesting and insightful context to the mindset of a certain character, there’s a lingering thought that it could’ve been handled in a less bothersome way.<br />
<br />
Now onto the girls themselves who make up the wonderful cast of Nijigasaki:<br />
<br />
First Years - Kasumi serves as the cute lovable goofball of the group. I won’t lie when I say that she might easily be one of the funniest and most entertaining characters I’ve ever seen. I appreciate the studio for going the extra mile in emphasizing and exaggerating her movements and facial expressions by adding in some nuanced animation in many of her scenes to strengthen the fact that she’s over the top and hilarious. While there are some obvious similarities that can be drawn to Nico, there is a bit of distinction between them. Kasumi strives to be the cutest idol but doesn’t put up a facade or have an alternate personality. She might be overenthusiastic and flamboyant at times (albeit for comedic purposes) but she is self-aware about other people’s feelings and deep down, she can be helpful to her friends and pull through when it matters. Rina is someone who is good with using technology and has excellent programming skills but she has difficulty expressing her emotions and making friends. She is a unique character to the series being the first who covers her face during performances. Shizuku has a passion for acting and because of this she is in the drama club. But below her calm exterior lies someone who is afraid to show and express her true self to others. The way in which the show portrayed her inner monologue is commendable as it works well both visually and thematically. As far as first year trios go in this franchise, I find Nijigasaki’s to be quite compelling as their character growth is apparent and carries over to the later episodes with a lasting impact. Rina and Shizuku’s episodes in particular coupled with their performances and songs were the ones that stood out to me as some of the strongest in the show and perhaps the franchise as a whole.<br />
<br />
Second Years - Setsuna is a standout character as she is a stunningly beautiful and passionate girl who performs in the first episode and is an inspiration for Ayumu and Yuu. She has a serious and hardworking side to her but also an energetic and vibrant personality. Plus she happens to be a fan of anime which earns some points in my book. Now concerning Ayumu...one may be led to believe that she serves as the lively leader of this Love Live group like how Honoka or Chika were for theirs, however, she is not at all similar to either of them. While those two characters shared attributes of being energetic and poised on becoming school idols, Ayumu is more shy and easily embarrassed. I would say that her friend Yuu serves the leadership role better and actively does so throughout the show. While she does have a strong attachment and reliance towards Yuu, she is a rather sweet and adorable person especially when she’s doing the Ayu-bun. Ai is the helpful and friendly athletic type. She has a strange affinity for puns though thankfully, this quirk of hers is not overused. With her laid back personality and positive attitude, she provides an added level of fun and liveliness to the group.<br />
<br />
Third Years - Kanata has an easy going and playful personality. She seemingly looks like a girl who only loves to sleep a lot and is not particularly flexible but there is more going on with her that results in this. It paints her as a far more interesting character than at first glance. Karin is a model with a more mature and cool headed personality who sort of serves as the Nozomi of the group i.e. the big sister figure who quietly watches from behind the scenes which is a welcome homage to the original. Despite her calm demeanor, she has a sweet and more innocent side to her. Emma is a girl from Switzerland who loves eating food. She has a kind and understanding personality which allows her to play a more supportive role in the group.<br />
<br />
Normally that would be it for the main cast, but in Nijigasaki there are now 10 main girls instead of the usual 9. It seems Love Live has indeed added one more to their already copious roster of female characters which at first glance would seem rather trivial but the way she’s utilized in the story is quite intriguing. Yuu more or less serves as a self-insert lens for the audience as well as someone for Ayumu to bounce off of. She is all about supporting her best friend and everyone else in the group and that can also be said for any fan who wants to cheer for these girls’ success. But she is not just a blank slate or a useless character. Even though Yuu herself does not want to become a school idol, she plays a pivotal role in bringing together several members acting as both a voice of reason and of motivation leading to some emotionally satisfying moments (and building up her harem all the same). She has a likable and charming personality while being reliable which makes her interactions all the more meaningful and in some cases absolutely hilarious.<br />
<br />
Of course it wouldn’t be Love Live without the music and suffice to say there are some straight bangers in this one. While there are some that stood out to me more than others (CHASE!, Solitude Rain, etc.), I somehow found myself listening to all of them an unhealthy amount of times. Now I liked quite a few songs from both the original group and Sunshine, but this...just hits different. Compared to previous entries which had primarily group songs, Nijigasaki focuses more on the individual with solos for each character reflecting their own ‘color’ and personality. This is even more emphasized by the different types of music they sing and their styles of performance such as the vocaloid-esque display from Rina or the stunning theatrical from Shizuku which all showcase the exuberant appeal of idols. Each one feels like a music video with its aesthetic, lighting, visual cuts and dynamic camera. As expected from this series, there is a keen eye for detail in the directing and choreography as well as overall fluidity with hair, mouth movement, and facial expressions. Everything matches up well with the lyrics. Since the main theme seems to be the girls coming together to represent a rainbow, the songs themselves signify each member being honest with themselves, moving forward, and ultimately accepting what they can bring to the group as a different color and standing side by side. That being said, while the new style is extravagant, it is noticeably different from past entries as most of the songs are not performed in reality but rather in a ‘dreamlike’ world where visuals are exaggerated. There also isn’t the familiar group song setting. In previous shows, the girls from μ&#039;s and Aqours had the capability of bouncing off one another. Here they have to perform alone which they do address in the show and have legitimate concerns for. But despite the fact that they are performing by themselves, I never got a sense that it was an inferior experience to past shows because each individual was able to stand out thanks to the emotional support from the other members of their group and the gradual buildup of their characterization from each of their arcs. Credit to the show, everyone seems to be on equal footing making it feel all the more worthwhile to believe that if the time comes for them to perform together, they can all stand proudly as school idols. Coupled with smooth and improved animation and amazing performances from the voice actresses, every live show is distinct and riveting. The OP “Nijiiro Passions!” is bursting with energy and excitement coupled with gorgeous visuals and for lack of a better term ‘pizzazz’ while the ED “NEO SKY, NEO MAP!” has its somber yet uplifting tone with vocals from each character giving the episodes a strong sense of closure. Both are worthy additions to an already stellar lineup of OPs and EDs in this franchise. The soundtrack is also great as it fits the upbeat and energetic scenes as well as some of the more somber moments pretty well.<br />
<br />
To sum up, Love Live Nijigasaki has proven itself to be a worthy addition to this franchise. It stands to reason that both Love Live fans and non-fans will likely find this to be a solid if not a fantastic entry and may end up being a little surprised by it. It certainly has a case for being one of the best. Despite whatever hiccups there were along the way, it was an absolute joy to watch. For newcomers, this can serve as a good starting point to the series as prior knowledge of past shows is not necessary. From the smooth and clean art style, improved animation, a different and fresh story, amazing songs, likable and memorable characters...it’s the full package. It improves on what the other entries lacked while also being distinct, having its own identity, and all while adding some new twists to the formula. It managed to implement all these changes yet none of them I feel were unwarranted and it was still able to maintain the charm Love Live has with its enjoyable goofy moments. Sure idol anime might not be everyone’s cup of tea but as someone who enjoys a more lighthearted show with cute characters that have a lot of personality and passion, this is one of if not the best I’ve seen. It managed to become a surprisingly meaningful experience and showed me that this franchise still has so much more enthusiasm to express.

    Love Live Nijigaku represents the next stage in the evolution of the best ongoing idol franchise. It takes everything we know and love about the series to new heights and breathes new life into the Love Live series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disclaimer, when it comes to idol shows, I am very easy to please. Cute girls, good songs and good performances are really all I look for. That’s why I was pleasantly surprised to see how much more Nijigaku contained. If you’ve seen sunshine and SIP, which you most likely have if you’re here, you’ll recall how fluffy and cutesy those shows were. While we had the drama of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369972">
        the school being forced to shut down in both seasons, there never really felt like there was drama or tension among the girls.<br />
<br />
Nijigaku deviates from that trend and actually introduces some pretty overt yuri romance/love triangle type situations with Ayumu, Yuu and Setsuna which I really liked. I felt like the tension between the three of them throughout the second half of the series was the best Love Live has ever been at. The story in general feels a bit more mature this time around. Of course there’s still the usual dramatisations that we have come to know and love, but in general things feel much more natural.<br />
<br />
Sunrise went with a different art-style this time around, which I personally think is the best LL has ever looked. I liked Sunshine’s art over SIP, but would take this over both of the previous series. It feels much more “real” rather than the uber cutsey nature of Sunshine. The CGI also needs to be applauded. We have come a LONG way since the days of SIP in terms of quality CGI. At times, I could not even distinguish the CG from the drawn images. <br />
<br />
Nijigaku has to be in my top 5 shows of the season and was probably the second or third most anticipated on a weekly basis. I think this season was an evolution for the franchise and bodes well for the future of one of my favourite idol groups. I’m looking forward to seeing what new heights the girls and this series reach. Love Live Nijigasaki gets 10 mics out of 10.<br />

    „Never get dragged into Love Live! idol hell or your wallet will hate you.”  <br />
- everyone who has already spent too much on Love Live! <br />
<br />
After the Aqours movie &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; (Love Live! Sunshine!!) in 2019 we finally get a Love Live! continuation with a new setting. All those fans who are already familiar with the Love Live! mobile games know what Nijigasaki is about. Even if the main goal is not the Love Live! competition this time, we feel that our girls are doing their best to make everyone happy. Lean back, relax and just enjoy the wonderful world and music of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369971">
        Nijigaku! <br />
The “Nijigasaki High School Idol Club” initially started with 5 members led by Setsuna Yuki (she is the same person as Nana Nakagawa, the student council president). But because of different goals and opinions, it was dissolved. Thanks to Yuu Takasaki, later becoming the manager of the group, it was brought back to life. The main difference to the previous Love Live! series is the solo idol performing by each of them. Since there is no threat of closing the school here, it is not necessary to win the Love Live! competition, our solo idols do not pursue this goal. Although they are rivals through their solo careers, they support and push each other. The deep friendship can be clearly felt. <br />
The Niji adaptation focuses on our nine idols and their manager and song composer Yuu. She is the budding school idol enthusiast of Nijigasaki High School. Her love for school idols blossomed after seeing the performance “CHASE” of the legendary school idol, Setsuna Yuki. She is Ayumu&#039;s inseparable childhood friend, the two support each other in every situation.  <br />
The dynamic relationship between Yuu and Ayumu is particularly striking. Ayumu quickly becomes jealous when Yuu is hanging out with Setsuna. After stumbled upon a school idol performance for the first time with Yuu, a new path suddenly appears in her world. Despite not being able to sing or dance, Ayumu would nevertheless venture on to become a school idol herself. She is a hardworking girl that puts her everything into what she does. She tries her best to be helpful to others. In most of the full unit songs from Nijigasaki, Ayumu is also the person taking the center place most of the time. <br />
The third second year of them is the most popular idol Setsuna. She has an energetic smile and a distinctive style of performing. With her love for anime, manga and video games, she shares the same interest with us. She lights up whenever she is asked a question about these. She has not only a lot of knowledge about idols, but is also one of the best in the other school subjects too.  <br />
Ai (愛-LOVE) is someone who’s always in a good mood and can cheer you up with her incredibly sociable attitude. Because she is a gyaru, she can be mistaken as the type to skip school or be rebellious. However, she has very good grades and is excellent at sports as well. She is also very caring, especially with her family and friends. <br />
Rina is Ai’s best friend. She admires Ai for her confidence and friendliness since she Rina is not good at conveying emotions on her face. During the performances on stage, she wears her self-created “Rina-chan Board” to show all the emotions. As a school idol, she hopes that people will cheer for her so she can show everyone her true smile. <br />
Another first year is Shizuku, our level-headed and mature honor student. She is considered a traditional Japanese beauty with her polite attitude. Besides dancing and singing, she is talented in acting and performing in plays, even being a member of the school&#039;s theater club.  <br />
“Kasukasu” (she doesn&#039;t like this nickname actually) had always dreamed of becoming an idol. She is the one always believed in the club and is determined to keep the dream alive. Kasumi loves all cute things, her love for idols is unrivaled in strength and inspiration. She wants to be number one in any competition she&#039;s in, and often resorts to cheating or even sabotage to achieve that goal. If you liked Nico-Nico-Nii from School Idol Project, you will love Kasu-Kasu-Miin.  <br />
Let’s take a look at our third years starting with the most mature girl in the whole Love Live! Series: Karin Asaka. She can use her adult-like looks to her advantage. Karin often tries to tease her underclassmen, or teach them lessons on how to be sexy and cool like her. Besides being a school idol, she works as a model for magazines.  <br />
Her roommate Emma from Switzerland has the biggest Bazookas of the whole Love Live! Franchise, even bigger than our shrine maiden Nozomi. Coming from a family with eight younger siblings, she would leave her home country to pursue becoming a school idol in Japan. Emma is very cheerful, pleasant, and tries to look after the other idols. She aims to be encouraging and to help others smile. <br />
Finally, we have my favorite character from Niji: Sleepy Goddess Kanata. Her little sister Haruka can also be seen in the anime. As the nickname suggests, Kanata loves sleeping and short power naps. At times, she will appear to be sleeping but is actually awake and listening to what&#039;s going on around her. Despite seeming always tired, Kanata is motivated as a school idol by her younger sister and others&#039; praise. She takes care of the others, she works hard, she can cook, she is the &quot;sleeping beauty&quot;.  <br />
Without the help of many other students and friends, our idols would not be able to realize their dream. In addition to our ten members of the club, we see many other support characters. They also give everything to make the perfect show possible!<br />
<br />
If you are already familiar with the art style from the previous Love Live! series, you will feel comfortable right away here as well. Love Live! always gives you a colorful and beautiful animation. I have to admit that there are small differences if you compare the style with School Idol Project! and Sunshine!! Nevertheless, you can still directly say after first sight: This is Love Live! It’s beautiful!<br />
<br />
What is very important for every idol anime is the music. Love Live! has never disappointed us in this point, we experience the wonderful music world of the idols once again here. Since Niji focuses on solo idols, we hear a lot of solo songs. From the fiery &quot;Chase&quot; from Setsuna to the beautiful &quot;Butterfly&quot; from Kanata, each girl shows us her personality with her own song. The singles are just nice to listen to. But this anime does not only delight us with singles, with the OP &quot;Nijiiro Passions!&quot; and ED &quot;NEO SKY, NEO MAP!&quot; we also get to hear two wonderful group songs. The Love Live! feeling can be felt directly, they managed to win our hearts with stunning music again!<br />
<br />
As someone who loves the idol group “μ&#039;s” more than anything and also enjoy “Aqours” a lot, Niji was definitely a must-watch for me. I always have a lot of fun watching and following Love Live! When the game &quot;Love Live! School Idol Festival ALL STARS&quot; was released on the Japanese Playstore, I was already able to find out a lot about our Niji members. But seeing them animated is a much bigger highlight and way better! Although I&#039;m not a big fan of solo songs, I still loved the singles. But of course, the OP and ED were just overwhelming.<br />
The Love Live! hell has a tight grip on me, but I love this hell. I can and will not escape from it!<br />
<br />
For every Love Live! fan there is no question whether Niji is worth watching, you have to do it! For those who has not been with Love Live! familiar before, I recommend starting with School Idol Project! first to find out how everything started. However, it is not necessary since in the anime Niji and μ&#039;s have no connection in common. So just enjoy Love Live! All parts are great!<br />
<br />
In the end, I&#039;m curious to see whether we will see the second season of Niji (not announced yet, but I am convinced it will happen) or even the latest project Love Live! Super Star !! first. No matter which one it will be, all are SUPER!<br />

    This was the surprise of the season for me. I gave the first Love Live a 5 - while I liked the idea of the franchise, the show itself was underwhelming. But Nijigasaki is a joy to watch. There is so much going on, I quickly got invested in a seasonal show that I initially had low expectations for (possibly because the character designs frankly look a bit generic).<br />
<br />
The animation is the most impressive part. There is tons of character animation in the show, I haven’t seen a cute girls show with characters moving this much in a while. As someone who admittedly spends more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361485">
        time thinking about anime than actually watching it, the amount of animation, and detailed animation, really makes me happy while watching.<br />
<br />
The music is great too, and the 3D models are much improved and look great. The placement/transitions to and from the dance sequences are really well done, as you enter and exit a sort of world of imagination, it feels very Love Live-y in a good way. I haven’t seen Sunshine (yet), but I may tentatively call this the definitive Love Live.<br />
<br />
The characters are much more natural and feel less like their respective cliches, though they still have that enjoyable ridiculousness that we expect from Love Live. One thing I noticed right away was that characters weren’t forced to have a spotlight or a line, and they didn’t always have to be all together for there to be group moments. That really helps in a show with such a large main cast. I appreciated that there isn’t too much drama or jokes, it’s mainly about simply enjoying time together in the School Idol Club. There isn’t much of a plot at all, at this point it feels like anything could happen. We need more than 13 episodes!<br />
<br />
The school setting deserves mention. It’s big, modern, and imaginative, and the rest of their city is too, and the background art is absolutely gorgeous and there is a lot of it. I love these slice of life shows with a slightly fantastical setting, and the overall mood of this show benefits greatly from it. It feels pleasant, like a place where I would want to live. I haven’t played the game or read anything about it, but this stood out in the anime.<br />
<br />
For those who haven’t seen any Love Live, I especially recommend this as a starting point. <br />
-----<br />
Late-night follow-up: I guess Nijigasaki has made me fall in love with Muse again. While the new one still blows past the original in many ways, I still am nostalgic for the first generation. The characters, facial expressions, and jokes were so great that they are so fun to think about even years later, truly icons of their time. I also miss the team-building aspects of Love Live and the whole story of a group coming together, though Niji has that unusual structure and unpredictability in story that is one thing that I love in anime (where Muse was so basic in every way). They aren&#039;t connected really at all, so it&#039;s a great time to hop on (and no boob-grabbing or questionable CG this time!). That background art though. I know it&#039;s just based on real places, but the artists truly elevate it with beautiful color, and a sense of depth and scale, and put them together to create a city that is so unreal in a fascinating way.<br />
<br />
The overall quality, effort, and thought put into Nijigasaki is still enough for me to put it higher, if the soul of the first Love Live might slightly beat it. I will have to go back and rate the original higher.

    I&#039;m honestly surprised people are rating this series so high. I&#039;m going to be one of the only ones who rates it this low lol All in all, very disappointed in this. Had high hopes for it since the designs were awesome, unlike the other new LL anime, but my hopes were crushed. (I come off as a game elitist sort of but I honestly barely played the game since I hate the mechanics. They&#039;re weird). <br />
<br />
Story: Absolutely nonexistent. Each episode is about a different character, which you would think would be good, but it isn&#039;t. The lack of an actual story lessens the impact

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364072">
        and appeal of the characters. I&#039;m not given a reason to care about the series itself since its basically just an add for the game. Also the drama doesn&#039;t even last and is only character related which makes it even more boring to watch. Nothing connects these episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: WHY did they use new art instead of the OG LL art? It&#039;s not bad but the previous art was just so much better. <br />
<br />
Characters: I have a hard time liking any of the characters outside of Kasumi and Shizuku. Maybe I&#039;m the only one but I feel like I&#039;m not given any reason to like any of the characters IN THE ANIME. The character stories in the game are so much better in my opinion and allow you to like the character. But the anime just does one episode on the character and then puts them to the side. <br />
<br />
Sound: Oh god. I never liked any of Niji&#039;s songs even in the game (except for a select few) and the same is for the anime, except I like absolutely none of the songs. Okay, I like Setsuna&#039;s music, but I absolutely hate her character so I chose not to include her.

    I really can&#039;t decide if I love this anime or don&#039;t like it. <br />
<br />
Not talking about quality, though, it&#039;s awesome, but about preference. I mean... The girls are all really cute, but some stuff feels unnatural: the musics are awesome... it&#039;s just odd someone randomly dancing in the middle of a park. I do enjoy watching it, though... but at the same time I don&#039;t...<br />
<br />
Dunno how to explain. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it is indeed an anime worthy of the Love Live name. And it&#039;s so different from the first that it doesn&#039;t really falls into that gray spot that Sunshine fell, where it&#039;s basically repeating what was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361694">
        successful. The downside of it is: if you did enjoy the two other series, it won&#039;t mean you are to enjoy this one. But you should definitely give it a try.

    *this review does contain spoilers*<br />
<br />
I have been following Love Live for quite some time now. I love the original series and adore Sunshine!! just as well to the point of creating art folders on my computer and even getting some minor merchandise pieces like keychains and cards.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I expected a lot from the third Love Live generation anime despite not knowing what it was going to try to represent. What I received was wasted potential and large disappointment.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to start my rant with, but I guess getting to the story first would be fitting because there is literally none of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370027">
        it. Unlike previous two parts, this had no to zero significant plot. Got to admit, it started kind of well. The first episodes seemed to show what might have ended up being a good storyline. However, once the characters got together (which as I remember happened about 3 episodes in) the whole thing went downhill with next half a show being what’s supposed to be ”character development” which is one of the points I will get back to later. After 10 episodes passed, it remembered it had something to tell. This is the moment we are introduced to… School Idol Festival. What even is that thing and where did they take our very own “Love Live”?... the thing this very show is supposed to be about?... the thing this show is basically named after?... Apparently, the thing that the first two parts were based around and named after simply does not exist in the Nijigasaki timeline. Why is this named Love Live if there is not a single word said about what was the main thing of the original series??? This should not be called Love Live. The story part has more to be told about and I am going to talk about those details in the next paragraph. Moving on.<br />
<br />
What I consider the main problem of Nijigasaki crew is the crew itself. Characters. Character development is made in the worst way possible. Instead of being naturally developed with the story (which as I mentioned earlier does not exist in the case of Nijigasaki) going on, every single character is forced into the viewer by having an entire episode dedicated to each of them. What’s so bad about it being like this? Let me explain. Imagine a narrator introducing characters giving a quick description of them in order they appear on the screen. Yes, those short descriptions explaining who the character is, what their interests are, their relations to the rest of the cast etc. In Nijigasaki anime, the descriptions are episodes and the order is the episode order. Every single episode until the SIF introduction just gives us information on characters the viewer is supposed to follow with literally zero further development. You have to accept the characters as they are. In fact, you are forced to do so. None of the characters in this show can be considered main. Every single one becomes main during their own episode. After that they vanish to just hang around for the rest of the screen time. Every time a certain girl appeared on the screen, it felt like they are here just to remind us what their quirk they were introduced in their episodes with is. Kasumi constantly being self-centered, Rina constantly taking out her Rina-board, Kanata constantly reminding us how tired she is etc. These went from fun little things to GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP ALREADY. When there was “drama” going on, I had no idea what my reaction was supposed to be. Why would they put the most uninteresting character aka Ayumu in a totally unnecessary drama? Just to show how she does not care about anyone but herself? I guess in her case being a bad character is better than being absolutely nothing because unlike her pals she does not have any specific characteristics other than being Yuu’s friend. How am I supposed to react to characters I never got to care about? Where does the drama itself come from when the whole cast is just having fun while being in literal fillers? The story does not move with the drama too, making it absolutely needless for both nonexistent plot and character development. <br />
<br />
This show does have good sights too. Sound and design. Not going to give any comments on the sound part, because, well, this show is centered around music (in fact it barely is, but at least it was supposed to). The character design is close to flawless. Love Live has always had great design, I just wish it was used on the right characters this time…<br />
<br />
All in all, the third generation Love Live anime is an awful show. It takes everything good and charming about its predecessors and throws it in the trash bin.  This was likely made as a fanservice material for the game fans, which I do not belong to the group of. I guess it is exciting to see characters you have known for years finally getting their own series. I understand why game fans and other people enjoy it and I respect their opinions. I, however, did not like this show. Not just as an alternative setting for two previous Love Live parts, but as a separate thing too.  Yes, I would rather watch another “our school is on the edge of getting closed so we have to become school idols to save it” than this.<br />
<br />
Ratings:<br />
Story - 1/10 <br />
Art - 8/10<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
Character - 1/10<br />
Enjoyment - 2/10<br />
<br />
If season 2 of Nijigasaki ever gets announced, I will not get excited for it as much as I was for this. But I really hope it is going to have something more to it other than unnaturally introduced characters and absent story the first season managed to get us through in its 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
“Nijigasaki? – more like Nijigasucky”, - I would say if I were to be Miyashita Ai, because making puns is what her entire character is about.

    First time reviewing a Love live while it is airing, and I&#039;m here to tell you how fun it is so far!<br />
<br />
This series of love live so far has offered a different sort of take on the usual tale of getting to the big event, and without the idea of the School closing down. Which is something fresh to see for a Love live series. Following a group uqnie and interesting girls, as how they progress towards their goals, and facing troubles along the way, still as interesting as the previous series and sunshine.<br />
<br />
The characters per usual have something about them, that makes them. Which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361260">
        is still fine. Having a great mesh of personalities can provide for some good entertainment. Also helps push the plot along, and create some interesting conflict within the characters. Better to grow and learn as you go on, than everyone getting along after all.<br />
<br />
The art is what you would expect for a Lovelive series, it&#039;s colourful, and pretty to look at. The backgrounds are really well done too, it really looks well polished. While the sound is very fitting for an idol show, from the sounds in the scenes themselves, to the great singing as per usual. You cannot go wrong there.<br />
<br />
Should you check it out? For sure! It&#039;s what you would expect in a Lovelive series, so you&#039;ll for sure enjoy it!

    This new anime from the Love Live franchise is a huge disappointment. The production is perfectly up to date, the CG is so good that for the first time it does not require the use of 2D in the concerts and the songs are wonderful but, besides these things, there is not much to be praised in Nijigasaki Doukoukai. And I say that as someone who loves the franchise. School Idol Project and Sunshine were great anime, while this one can&#039;t get anywhere near that.<br />
<br />
This review may contain light spoilers. Not that I say anything that could ruin your experience, but I comment on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369976">
        structure of this story to exemplify what exactly makes Nijigasaki Doukoukai a disappointment for me.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10. My biggest problem with this spin-off of the franchise is the fact that it doesn&#039;t have a story, however bizarre it may seem. This is because the series uses the first 9 episodes to introduce the girls one by one and literally does nothing else during that time. Watching these episodes gives me the feeling that I am playing a gacha game in which, each week, it releases the side story of one of the characters. However, there is no main story.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the most important thing for Nijigasaki Doukoukai is to sell waifu. When, after 9 episodes of selling waifu, the anime decides to tell a story, there is no basis for anything. Mainly because it is very difficult to remember each of the girls who have been introduced over the past 9 weeks. In the case of each of them, what happens is the following: in her episode, she matters. In the other 8 of this early phase of the series, the anime hardly remembers that she exists.<br />
<br />
At the time of the last few episodes, the script tells you that months have passed and you have to accept it just because, since there was no indication of the passage of time in the initial nine episodes in which the anime was concerned exclusively with selling waifu. So the script talks about how X character has been working hard lately, but the only thing we saw from her was in her presentation episode and she was practically irrelevant in the other 8, with very few exceptions.<br />
<br />
This makes it impossible to create a connection with any character in this anime and it also makes it impossible to create a connection with the story itself, since there is no story. Nijigasaki Doukoukai doesn&#039;t even have any sense of unity. It seems to be nine different animes in the first nine episodes and, from 10 onwards, it becomes something just boring and uninteresting. What reason do I have to be invested in whatever they are doing in the last four episodes if I don&#039;t care about any of these characters? You can&#039;t like someone who was relevant in just one of the nine episodes the anime has had untill then. If these first nine episodes of the series were about the club, this could be quite different. But the anime chose to talk exclusively about each of the characters in these episodes and this structure ensured that none of them were really important to the story since, going back to the starting point, there is no story.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10. I have nothing to criticize regarding this anime in its visual aspect. The studio knows where to put a budget, even if it means turning the other anime of the season into a slide show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10. The sound design, original soundtrack and especially the songs are of the highest level, as usual. Incidentally, this is the first anime in the franchise that makes me want to have its OST, for having some songs from the moments of slice of life that do not leave my head.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10. They&#039;re not bad, but the script definitely doesn&#039;t help me like them. It&#039;s like I pointed out above: in the first nine episodes, each character exists in only one of them and is practically forgotten in the other eight, with rare exceptions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10. All the problems in this anime make my experience watching it far from good. As much as the anime is impeccable in technical aspects such as art, sound and direction, this fact alone cannot sustain an anime without a story and cannot make me think it was worth watching.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10.<br />

Anyway, as much as it hurts me to say that, I do not recommend Nijigasaki Doukoukai to any fan of Love Live. Perhaps the only ones that this anime can really satisfy are those who already knew the game and just wanted to see the characters from the game in an animated series. If this is not your case, I recommend that you pretend that Nijigasaki Doukoukai does not exist and wait for Love Live Superstar.

    Weebs, a derisive term for a person that love a moral-degenerate products from Japan. These peoples got humilation from society by rain of disgusted &amp; despise gazes, yet they still survive and keep on moving so proudly. So actually those small species are a strong humans that true to themself, never wear a mask just to get accepted by society (I mean persona mask not for Corona).<br />
<br />
Idol, one of a few genre at the pinacle of weebness, the teams behind them never half assed making product as a countermeasure for general labelling from society. And inside them there are two biggest title called Love Live!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363740">
        &amp; iDOLM@STER. This time as well, they success making a great series in hope for strengthening their endangered species with Nijigaku.<br />
<br />
School Idol Club, three words enough to give the viewer a prediction on how this thing going to be. There are a club that accommodate students who want to be an idol, because the setting is in school they’ll face a problem that usually, mostly, n’ definitely from Seito-kai. They will work together to solve this and reach a happy ending, the end. So I won&#039;t expect another story &amp; just want to enjoy the performances, that&#039;s what I thought.<br />
<br />
While our speculation is not wrong, at the same time it’s not totally corect as well. Instead of evading our forecast, they choose to just accept it. Story worth a dozen of episodes packed skillfully into just 3 ep without giving a bad taste of rushed script. Leaving the audiences running out of predictions onwards. (detail on spoiler down there)<br />
<br />
The appealing part of Idol genre, yappari it’s the performances. As an experienced franchise they didn’t fail to meet our expectation. Generaly they are all good, even better than the source counterpart (game).<br />
<br />
Chase! A great choice as the 1st performance, selecting manager (nominee) &amp; pink girl as viewpoint is also a smart pick as they represent two type of targeted audience. Manager can be likened as a new fan of series who just taste the enjoyment of idol and Chase! did a great job at pulling them with passionate song &amp; awesome stage effect combined with the story made us felt the same as manager.<br />
<br />
Dream With You. Don’t want to give you expectation but it’s best performance so far. Pink girl suits really well with all type of watcher, a newb or veteran. Still like cute things (for her) or Idols (for us) made an adult felt embarrassed if the world found out, it gave us anxiety. Yet this performance respond it with: how come they won’t admit these kawaii-ness? The already great song still lifted up with great visual, cute choreo, smooth animation even transition into 2D still keep the quality. Costume feels a bit too big for her but that’s what make it cute &amp; not much skin revealing as a prove that idol isn’t always about sexiness. Sasuga #1 fav char at latest poll on game.<br />
<br />
(light spoiler ep 123)<br />
Lot of things prepared beforehand so everything can be swept in one go (I mean 3). Problem from sassy child is just a different opinion with leader, so it can be solved by changing her point of view. I like how they pick an exact sentence to make her realized by herself. Seito-kai &amp; Club leader have a relation since start, so the disband threat can be solved with a great speech by manager. I really like how they intentionally add a clumsy line after such a strong scold by manager to keep her character modest, so she doesn’t sound like a shounen protagonist solve anything with talk-no-jutsu. After these mainstream story of school club setting, the studio can freely write each characters’ specific story. So, what lay ahead?<br />

    I’m going to start off by saying that I am a huge love live fan, I absolutely loved school idol project and to a lesser extent also enjoyed sunshine quite a bit. Needless to say I was very hyped when I saw that Love Live was getting another iteration to the point where I went and downloaded the game to learn more about the upcoming characters. <br />
<br />
But oh boy was I disappointed. I have been reading other people’s review and can’t understand why exactly they liked so much about it. <br />
<br />
Love Live is an anime about music and character progression through trials and frustration, developing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370046">
        and evolving personalities and songs as they become more acquainted with each other and live their lives. School idol project placed its songs exactly where they needed to be. START:DASH!! was placed in S1EP3 to show the beginning of their story, the start of their dreams and journey. Snow Halation showed their emotional progression and attachment to each other. <br />
<br />
But why did I go through the effort of explaining School Idol Project story telling? Well, because Nijigasaki does a 180 turn and goes the other direction. It introduces each character individually, making each the focus of the story. Sure, some of their stories can be sweet and show character development like Shizuku and her inferiority complex, but this in exchange takes a big toll on the world development and group mechanics. Now we have not only less impactful characters because they hardly get any screen time aside from their one episode, but the songs are less emotionally impactful. <br />
<br />
When Nijigasaki actually tried to shift their focus from single characters to multiple, it started off decently, meaning for the first 10 minutes of episode 10. After that I believe they ruined what people considered a fairly interesting character, being Ayumu. I’ll say it straight, I very much dislike yuri anime, and introducing it to the show made what I thought was an already uninteresting progression even worse. Ayumu simply came off as a petty and selfish person. Other characters aside from her got little to no screen time, so what could have been two and a half episodes setting up a future plot (which I thought would have been to bring together the 9 girls to sing together and shoot for love live), was simply a selfish yuri romance insert. <br />
<br />
Character drama and story telling is bad enough, but at the end of the day, Love Live is a show focused on music, so how does that fare? Well, in my opinion, very badly. I personally loved the 9 member voice, exchanging centers and show dynamics of School Idol Project and Sunshine, and that to me is what made it unique. We had 9 girls singing and dancing a captivating choreography, mixing and matching which voice would go better at certain parts of the song. But we don’t get any of that in Nijigasaki. We get some interesting songs with, well, low impact aside from the very first time you watched it. To put what I’m trying to get at into perspective, the song I most enjoyed and went back to listen in this entire series was the opening. <br />
<br />
Edit: Also just a tack on thought, who makes their music? From what I&#039;ve seen there was no Maki or Riko in the show, and most characters seem to have no knowledge of music composition. This might be nit-picking as obviously in the original cast or sunshine they didn&#039;t have a band to make guitar sounds and such, but having one character that understands it makes it more believable, or at least suggestive of skill, the songs being a master-piece. This is an anime afterall, we&#039;re conecting to the charcaters and not the people behind their voices. <br />
<br />
Now, what I also want to know is why the series is called Love Live? I only heard one mention of it during the entire series and that when Setsuna was fighting with Kasumi about their training sessions before they had more members. At that point, it made sense, and gave the viewers a sort of familiar feeling about the struggles of becoming a popular group and arriving at the Love Live stage. But then episode 10 came and Yuu said “let’s do a school idol festival”, whatever that is. Why? The girls did nothing to deserve them acting so high and might to stand with other presumably popular groups like Touou academy. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, I think that Nijigasaki is a wasted potential in storytelling, lacks impactful songs and misses the mark of what I considered interesting in the Love Live franchise. My hope for the future of the series, although unrealistic, is that they drop Nijigasaki altogether and go back and improve upon the original series with a new cast. <br />

    Let me preface this by saying I&#039;m not particularly a fan of Love Live. I like some of the songs, but that&#039;s pretty much it in terms of my engagement with the series. The only reason I decided to watch this because I do like the character designs this time round, and I enjoyed the Famitsu 4koma a great deal.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the positives. There isn&#039;t a &quot;Save the Club&quot; or &quot;Save the School&quot; plot, apart from a very brief moment where they re-established the club in the very beginning. Kasumin is absolutely adorable and best girl, her antics never fail to elicit a smile

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370020">
        on my face, she truly is an aisare kyara. But among all your standard one-episode drama episodes is the infamous episode 11, where you do get a glimpse of what may be, a glimmer of potential if it wasn&#039;t for corporate oversight or conservative production committee decisions. Episode 11 was easily one of my favourite episodes from any anime, from the cinematography to the episode direction, the latter half of it genuinely gave me chills and had me wonder if the creative team would fundamentally shake up the status quo of Love Live with regards to its character dynamics.<br />
<br />
Of course, things never turn out as what you&#039;d hope. All the buildup to that moment with Ayumu&#039;s building jealousy is resolved in the most anti-climactic non-romantic way possible. It&#039;s as if they are actively downplaying and burying any romantic subtext between the characters for a &quot;just friends&quot; and &quot;fulfilling dreams&quot; excuse instead of doubling down. <br />
<br />
Most other episodes follow a very basic structure where the girl of the week gets into some minor drama with herself or other characters and resolves everything very simply and with a song. Apart from Kasumi&#039;s and Ai&#039;s episodes, I wasn&#039;t particularly enraptured by any of the other episodes, and felt that they could have been handled better. In fact, my preference would have been to focus on the Ayumu x Yuu drama from the very beginning instead of having it be very minor background elements in order to have it climax at episode 11. <br />
<br />
Music-wise, HASHIRIDASHITA is so good you can see why Yuu started loving Idols in the first place. However none of the other songs quite managed to reach that level of excellence (even Setsuna&#039;s other song). I did like Ai&#039;s and Karin&#039;s solos, and of course the amazing ED, but for an idol show to have 30% of the songs that truly appeal to me is pretty lacking. But hey, at least you do get a decent variety for songs.<br />
<br />
Love Live isn&#039;t for everyone and it definitely wasn&#039;t for me, but at moments, you can really see something truly special buried underneath a lot of play-it-safe moments, where they didn&#039;t choose to innovate enough when there&#039;s clearly room to grow. <br />
<br />

First, the animation. Nijigasaki really blew it out of the park. Go watch an old muse mv, you&#039;ll see what I mean. Beyond that, I really wasn&#039;t a fan of the beginning episode structure (introduce character, minor problem with character, they sing away their problems), but after they got into the actual story, the quality tripled. In both the storyline and studio decisions (not competing, solo idols), their message was that there isn&#039;t one clear answer to success, which resonated deeply with me. Overall, a slow start but definitely a 10 at the end. S2 definitely on track for 10!

    Idol anime is something in the anime community that is quite contentious, unlike regular slice of life series, very few people watch idol anime for the sake of watching idol anime, and most fans either love or hate the genre altogether. The fanbase to outsiders are considered to be annoying or obsessive, while people on the inside view outsiders as closed minded. Due to the opposing views this review will focus heavily on reviewing the series from the perspective of somebody who is already an idol anime fan, this review is not made to sell the average person on idol anime but to highlight to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369969">
        idol anime fans why this installment of Love Live is truly exceptional and of all the idol anime I have witnessed, this one shines the absolute brightest. <br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
Due to differences in creative perspective and effort put into running the school idol club, it disbanded, but a bunch of new girls coming to the school saw Setsuna’s last performance and were inspired to try and get everyone back together. At some point they also decide to get serious about becoming school idols and put a lot of effort in to get better at performing and advertising themselves. Yeah it is pretty easy to see that the overall plot is very basic, however, idol anime has never been about the big picture or overall story. What idol anime shines at is making a lovable cast full of interesting characters, a variety of personal issues and backstories, and lots of drama and growth among the cast as they aim to achieve their dreams. This installment of Love Live achieves this perfectly, we see characters get over their hang ups of embarrassing themselves or being scared of audiences, we see people get past trauma from their past, the show tells some good stories about a cast of girls reaching for the stars despite their personal issues.<br />
<br />
The setting is also a bit interesting, yes, it’s just a highschool, however it’s a giant school the size of a university campus building with a massive side cast. Over time this setting really immerses the audience in the world of the idols, and it’s the perfect environment for these idols to grow, its definitely one of the best highschool settings in anime as far as interesting people and scale. Its also worth noting that the setting this time around was about saving a school club and just making it a success, there wasn’t any stakes about saving a school or getting to nationals, but that is alright, it allowed for a lot more focus on each individual girl and their own spotlight performance.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
Something that needs to be said right away before mentioning anything else, the color scheme in this series is amazing, seriously. Every other traditional idol anime tends to be way to brightly or light colored, enough that it actually hurts my eyes to watch them, even if I like the series. This show has a very saturated color scheme and isn’t to shiny or plastic looking, which improved the viewing experience several times over. <br />
<br />
Now that we got color scheme out of the way, lets talk about what really makes an idol show successful, that’s right character designs and performances. The character designs in this installment of Love Live happen to be some of the absolute cutest every made, now that’s not saying a lot since most idol designs are super cute, but less bright and shiny look actually really forces the audience to pay attention to the small details of the girls. From the way Kasumi’s hair is slightly parted at the back to Ayumus earrings and bracelet, every bit of the character designs are made to give life to the girls and bring out their best and most cute look. Focus on solo performances has also been a great change compared to most idol anime, due to how much movement idol dances required a lot of idol anime would have a normal looking show but a ridiculous hot mess of bad CGI for the dances, however this Love Live is different. <br />
<br />
The focus on solo performances means that only 1 performer has to be animated and the entire cast don’t all need to be in proper sync during the dance. This has led to a reduction of the CGI used to cut costs, and also allows for each performance to be centered around a specific girls theme and character design. Solo performances really bring out the best of each girl and every girls performance had amazing backgrounds, choreography and animation compared to prior Love Live series.<br />
<br />
The sound: 9<br />
<br />
Of course, a show about idols is not complete without great music and giving every girl their own solo performance leads to a large array of excellent top tier songs and definitely the best music overall this season. Every single girl has an amazing performance, all the songs hit multiple genres and come with an excellently choreographed performance, the sheer variety in the songs and performance styles puts this show above all the others this season for soundtrack. The opening and ending are also quite good, as expected, although not the best this season due to some really strong performances from other series, they are still among the top 5.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
Every single girl is absolutely adorable and they each have their only thorough fleshed out personality and reason to want to become an idol. Be it wanting to make friends, wanting to shine, trying to become cuter, trying to find something they enjoy, doing it for their sister, and a number of other reasons, all the girls have backstories that are central to their decision to become an idol and relate to their performance theme. The cast is also developed in a way that is a bit different from other Love Live installments, in that there is very little drama in between the main cast, and instead all the problems are personal or between family for the most part. Every girl overcomes an issue and incorporates it into their performance, they make their weaknesses their strengths, they all live up to being excellent idols.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
This is probably my personal favorite Love Live, due to a mixture of the unique approach of solo performances, the significantly less shiny art style and coloring, the overall setting of the school and the performances using very little CGI but incorporating significant movement. It gets a solid 8 for enjoyment and if you’re a fan of Love Live, you will definitely enjoy this season.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Everything is solid, there is no clear weak point to the anime, all its technical production values are excellent, the setting and story are fine for an idol anime, most importantly the girls are all likable and well developed. This installment of the Love Live series exceeds expectations and is a shining example of what every idol anime should strive to achieve.<br />

    This is my first ever review on this site lol, ok, so Love Live, the third title of the series. And as the last episode aired today. (Sobs like Kasukasu) I&#039;m completely satisfied, yeah, completely satisfied with this first season so far (I presume that there will be a second season cause, u know, it&#039;s a tradition of the Love Live franchise to have a second season and a couple of movies) I better stop the bs now. <br />
<br />
Edit w/ a minor spoiler on this sentence for people who have finished this anime; if not, proceed to the next paragraph: Chances for a second season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368732">
        increases cause presumably they follow the story of All Star then they need to include that first year girl as a member. Well I&#039;m not 100% neither 70% or 45% I&#039;m just hoping to get another season lol.<br />
<br />
I gave the story an 8/10 as it&#039;s a little cliche. Like all Love Live seasons mostly has one goal. To shine, but in the case of Love Live School Idol Project and Love Live Sunshine, they have a really important reason to do it. But here in Nijigasaki HS, they only did it because they wanted to. Well the reason why they formed it is because of the School Idol Club being abolished as it&#039;s on the plot (club on the SIF game where Nijigasaki was born [I&#039;m glad to see them now in animation after years of being on that game] and also in the All Stars) but it&#039;s safe to say that most people who have watched this would agree for the story being an 8 out of 10, and 8 is a pretty high number for a title with just teenage girls singing and doing cute stuff.<br />
<br />
10/10 for the art style. It&#039;s still the same as the two titles though but the art is perfect for the anime. Colorful, bright, aesthetically pleasing, the ED art was aight too (I hope Season 2 sticks to this type of artstyle on ED as it&#039;s unskippable because of the song CURSE YOU &quot;NEO SKY, NEO MAP!&quot; for giving me eargasm). The CGI is also a big noticable animation and animes like this are famous for this (Pointing out BanG Dream but that anime was fine) but the CGI is the perfect animation on the dancing parts to make it visually fine. Nevertheless, the art and animation is a solid 10.<br />
<br />
Oh God, I love all the music here and I can&#039;t wait to buy some DVDs in the future. Even if you&#039;re aren&#039;t a fan of J-Pop or idols, you&#039;ll still bop to the songs here. I won&#039;t say too much about the music, cause it&#039;s generally what makes a Love Live, a love live, all I could say is it&#039;s good, some songs are decent, some are fire, and as a person who knows and understands Japanese IMO almost all songs on Nijigasaki are my fav. Though I still love some songs on SIP and Sunshine, I&#039;d still chose Nijigasaki when it comes to soundtrack, albums etc. But most people still stick to SIP, can&#039;t blame them as SIP has tons of goods songs. Same with Sunshine.<br />
<br />
Characters are very likeable, every girl has a different personality *cough* cause it&#039;s love live *cough* *cough*, anyways the characters are intriguing, some have unique traits and some have the &quot;Absolute 100% normal humanbeing&quot; kind of trait. A Narcissist, a dull but joyful techno girl, a girl that has Narcolepsy (which Kanata-chan should indeed seek a doctor), A free-spirited girl but these is what makes the anime engaging. And I really appreciated Yuu, although Nijigasaki sticks to 9 members as it&#039;s also a tradition. Yuu is a main character, though her role is supporting it&#039;s not that I&#039;m complaining. Infact, it&#039;s this why I rated this anime high, new plot, new way on how the story progress, new unique dialogue to discover and since the new girl made it to the Nijigasaki story line. I rated Characters as 9 just because they are 9 members hehe. Nah I&#039;m kidding, it&#039;s not perfect but they are completely suitable for story progression. And the seiyuus are perfect for their characters in the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment? It&#039;s a damn 10/10. Everything is just perfect, from the OST, Opening and Ending, the Yuri moments, the jokes, the art, the character sudden urge to do something boring but it&#039;s a cute anime girl so I&#039;m here to observe and be blessed. This anime is the show where you dont need action, romance, harem to make it amazing. Just a sudden suprise for a Live song at every end of an Episode is enough to make you feel alive again. Some dialogues are cheesy, some are philoshopical, I&#039;m joking. Overall it&#039;s an anime for all people. And also, at their YouTube channel, the seiyuus of Nijigasaki are making Live videos on advertising just like how Sunshine seiyuus did in the past (I only saw one live on SIP like years ago). So free QUALITY CONTENT for now. <br />
<br />
<br />
You might be thinking &quot;Oh wow this review is complete biased even though the other two Love Lives are a little same to Nijigasaki HS&quot; first and foremost, my love for Sunshine and the seiyuus and characters are bigger than NHS and SIP but Nijigasaki HS seems unique as a Love Liv... heck... as an anime based on singing, I know there are animes with greater plot (Or rather enjoying plot) and songs like K-on, Hibike! Euphonium, Idolm@ster etc but there&#039;s something about Nijigasaki HS that makes me feel at ease but I can&#039;t put my finger on it. If you&#039;re an ex Love Live fan, this anime is a must! Side note that this anime has no relation to Sunshine or SIP but heck it&#039;s still good. This anime is for all ages as it&#039;s a wholesome show. And to some people who has different taste, this anime could either be your morning coffee or a normal pie dessert.Eitherway it&#039;s an enjoying ride for people who likes and appreciates Japanese songs. Okay, ttyt i&#039;m going to buy Love Live Nijigasaki HS Merch now cause POV you&#039;re seeing a dumbass who loves this things, but lemme tell you that this dumbass ain&#039;t a virgin. Also, where is a Yuu Nesoberi?

    As someone who has been stuck in idol hell for almost four years, I must say that this new generation has a good story and is full of surprises. Although the main point of this show is probably to promote their game, they still made a different story from the previous generation, and it was something new that made the rise of this show.<br />
<br />
In terms of the story, it was nice to see something new in Love Live with major problems that are different from the previous generation, μ&#039;s and Aqours. It was interesting to watch how their progress to become a school idol being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369995">
        told in separate episodes. Not to mention, we got to see ourselves as a school idol manager in this show is a rare sight.<br />
<br />
For art or animation, it was pretty mediocre since there&#039;s a lot of difference compared to previous Love Lives (other than the CG animation), and it was kind of a disappointment where they didn&#039;t animate the 3D models during the important shows (i tried not to write a spoiler, either way, that one itself stand my reason to give this show a solid 7). Apart from that, the animation still looks good for the most part. This franchise keeps making money from their games and their lives, i&#039;m sure it was worth it with the CG visuals.<br />
<br />
If we talk about sound, then it was good, nothing special. The voice actresses also voiced their characters really well. Nothing much to worry about. For the songs in every episode, it was great. I haven&#039;t played the game but to think that they had nice songs to listen to, i might as well give it a try soon.<br />
<br />
Character development in this one was amazing yet lame at the same time. We got to see each character&#039;s problem throughout the series, they all got their own episode, but how they managed to become school idol in this series is very predictable, it&#039;s not like i have a complaint but it&#039;s boring how i wait every week and all i got was a very wack episode. Yes i know they are supposed to be a solo idol but still, the forced drama and whatsoever, totally not my type. Other than that, it was still enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed their performances in several episodes and they had nice songs. By far, Setsuna wins my heart on this one, her charming character really warms my heart, and she&#039;s also had two personalities which are why, her character is so relatable at some point. Nijigaku starts to grow a bit on me, really enjoyable to fill up my Saturday&#039;s mood, probably because i haven&#039;t watched any idol anime other than Sunshine back in the days.<br />
<br />
Overall it was a great ride watching this. I&#039;m also glad i can appreciate the voice actresses&#039; works on this one like it rarely happened to me. It was fun while it lasted, and totally worth watching for those who play the game. If there&#039;s an announcement for a second season to happen in the future then i hope they make this show more interesting by making a new character an appearance since there are still more characters in the game that haven&#039;t been introduced yet. For now, all i can do is wait for their other work, Love Live Superstar, i hope it won&#039;t be a letdown, since they only have fewer members compared to other Love Live groups.

    Just, i cant stop appreciating to this anime since its first debuting artstyle. <br />
<br />
can&#039;t get enough with every possible nijigaku anime songs, they just made whole new feeling out of their composed musics from each characters. i keep getting goosebumps time after time to see overall works for this anime.<br />
<br />
Also, how they put characters to this anime, it portait very-very powerful self-view as themselves. <br />
<br />
one point thats very weak for this anime is that approach between characters with other characters. just they need to do more for that plothole.<br />
<br />
nah im not reffering this anime story as its game story (since i&#039;ve never actually read the

        game story itself.)

    Love live! Nijigasaki I find it less interesting than the previous two anime about Love Live! The story does not have one continuous story but is divided into individual episodes, which is not as enjoyable to watch as the previous ones.<br />
However, the very idea of not one group of idols but individuals with different characters was a refreshing idea. Each of the protagonists represented themselves on stage or off stage in their own way. We see different performances in each episode, and as in previous editions of Love Live! everyone can find the idol they like the most, with whom they associate the most.

    Love Live: Nijigasaki is simply the best idol show we&#039;ve seen since the original Love Live finished airing in 2014. I expected the show would be a cool tie in to the Love Live School Idol Festival games, and would be mostly made to appeal to those who play them and that&#039;s about it, but those proved to be wrong. Instead, we got a show that introduced (or fleshed out if you already knew them from the games) a captivating cast of idols, completely blew up the well and tried formula of idol shows (especially Love Live itself), and gave us possibly the best 3D

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370509">
        animation seen to date in any anime. <br />
<br />
Firstly before talking about the plot and characters, I think it&#039;s important to talk about the animation quality of Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai which is arguably it&#039;s strongest point. One of the often critiques of the Love Live shows has been about it&#039;s animation quality, and particularly it&#039;s 3D animation quality. All of those critiques were squashed by this show. Nijigasaki rarely has a poor quality 2D frame (unlike the much lower budget 1st season of the original Love Live), and it&#039;s 3D animation is simply mind blowing. The jump in quality of 3D that was made in only three years since Love Live Sunshine ended by Sunrise is seriously hard to believe. Unlike the previous two Love Live series, Nijigasaki created a formula in which most episodes ended with an insert song performance by one of the idols. These insert songs are almost entirely done in 3D, rather than the standard of the series which is to mix 2D (for closeups) and 3D for zoom out shots. The 3D models, motion, landscapes, and effects are simply unrivaled with any anime that I have seen to date. These insert songs are also far more exaggerated then we have seen in previous incantations of the series and do a better job in my opinion of being truly memorable performances. The overall aesthetic of the show is quite different than the previous Love Lives as well with the color palette choice giving it a unique feel. <br />
<br />
The story of Nijigasaki is completely different from the previous two series. There are zero direct references to either of the original series (a huge criticism of Sunshine), and the show tries to make it very clear right from the get go that the ultimate goal of these girls is not the same as in the previous series. There&#039;s also a new element to the show that I feel was a strong choice by Sunrise. The main plot driver of the show for the first time in Love Live, is not the leader of the group, but instead a girl who isn&#039;t actually an idol or really a part of the group. The show has much more of a third person vibe for this reason as you feel more like you are watching the plot and character development from an outsider perspective than in the previous shows. While the show does have some very clear callbacks to plot elements from the previous two, it changes them up enough that they don&#039;t feel samey. There is also definitely a more &quot;mature&quot; vibe to the show than the previous ones, especially in regards to some of the animation and the Yuri sub-plot that goes on in the season. <br />
<br />
From top to bottom I feel that Nijigasaki has an argument of having the best cast of idols of any Love Live or idol show to date. Unlike the previous spin-off, it feels far less like they just switched around a few of the girls personalities or hair colors and left the overall cast virtually the same. Sunrise also did a spectacular job of developing the girl&#039;s characters over the course of the season. You have plenty of reason to be invested in and care about virtually every girl, and they each got at least 1 episode dedicated to furthering their main story line. This was essential in fleshing out the characters of a few girls that I had personally never really cared about before the show from playing the games (Shizuku and Karin specifically.) This time around there are all new anime-girl trope types that we hadn&#039;t seen before in Love Live including a kuudere and (soft) yandere character. Ayuumu is also a refreshing change to the role of (defacto) leader of the group, as she&#039;s not another orange haired genki subtype, but instead a mishmash of various tropes and a very well-rounded character. Even the girls who feel similar to ones in the past (notably Kasumi who is quite similar to Nico) are different enough that they don&#039;t come off as retreads. <br />
<br />
Overall, there is something for virtually everyone in this show. If you are into Love Live, you are going to absolutely love Nijigasaki. If you like idol shows, you will probably love the insert songs as well as the idols. If you are a fan of school slice of life/moe, you will like the melodrama and story as well as the moe (though it&#039;s not quite as pushed as the previous two series yet.) I highly recommend giving Love Live: Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai a watch. <br />
<br />
P.S. I thought episode 7 was the best of the series by a mile.
