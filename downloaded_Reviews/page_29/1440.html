    Re:Creators the definition of CREATIVITY! Everything about this anime is unique and special especially the recap episode. From mecha to magic girl, any types of the character that you could ask for will be appear in this anime.<br />
PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THE RECAP EPISODE!<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Just when &quot;Isekai&quot; trend is everywhere, this anime use the concept of reverse Isekai where the character from the fantasy world coming out to join the real world instead of the protagonist blend into some parallel world. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The animation is not the best but is good enough in the year of 2017. Nothing outstanding but you will realize that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257674">
        working team is giving out their all into the art after you watched the recap episode.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 - STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!<br />
One word - Epic! Both opening theme song are awesome but the first one is better. Moreover, several soundtrack could just simply become one of the best OST in 2017 like AL:Lu, brave the oceans, layers, here i am and god of ink. Hiroyuki Sawano, you are a legend!<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10 - AWESOME!!!<br />
This anime got every types of character and its actually insane! What is your favorite type of anime? Mecha like Gundam? Female knight like Saber in fate series? Magic girl like Madoka Magica? RomCom like Toradora? or even wizard, princess, yakuza, gunner, delinquent, psychotic murderer, military, tragedy. Yes, you read it right. Every single one of it will be appearing inside this anime. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Me? Of course, I am extremely enjoying this series. In my personal opinion, this is the best anime that I had ever watched. Outstanding in the music and the idea of fitting every single possible types of character into one anime. The ending is kind of like a little bit unexpected but it also stick with the anime&#039;s concept which is being unique and special.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
They do not copy. They are not lazy. The soundtrack is awesome. The character design is marvelous. The story is special. This anime is really unique. For example, the way they had done their recap episode is not like the other anime where the working team just cut and edit the past scene. Re:Creators&#039;s recap episode is one of the protagonist recap the past scene for us with the mixture of the protagonist&#039;s point of view and the working team took the opportunity to criticize the negative opinion toward the current anime industry in Japan and complaining their current workload to the studio. In my opinion, I think I just witness the birth of the most OP character ever, ALTAIR!<br />
Doubt my review? Why not give the first episode a try? <br />

    Oh boy, Re:Creators. It’s a modern example of how a show that could have been a big hit of the year that ultimately translated into a messy series that self-destructed. It’s not just a flop but serves as a metaphor for how original series struggles to keep ideas effective. Don’t get me wrong. The series’ premise about story worlds clashing with sci-fi and fantasy elements sounds very intriguing. Yet somehow, it found many ways to ultimately make this look like an attempt at easy crash grab for the unexpected.<br />
<br />
At first glance, this series sounds really interesting. As an original anime, the creators seems to have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257665">
        decided to take a risk and mix many genres together. Fantasy, sci-fi, magic, isekai, and even mecha are just a few among these. However, what really caught my attention for this series is the fictional worlds and their characters. Every world has its own unique story as well. Not to mention, these stories has its creators and the characters they created. While all this really sets up the show as a mesmerizing story, I can’t help but find this series to be a flop in the most disappointing ways possible.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes of the show wastes little time to introduce the main characters. That’s good news since the cast seems to feature a unique set with characters of all different types. Magical girl, mecha pilot, princely knight, supernatural NPCs, anti-heroes, you name it. The most normal character among them is a young man named Souta Mizushino. He is inspired to become a light novel author but somehow manages to get caught into fierce fight one day. Souta gets involved in the conflict with the clash of fictional worlds, creators, and the characters. From the start, I can honestly say that the show actually has a mystique that kept me interested. Many questions pop up and it makes me wonder how this anime plans to resolve them. The characters also brings the attention of their purpose and why they are there in the first place. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can’t really say these characters are creatively presented. For instance, there’s Selestia Upitiria, the main protagonist of ‘Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier’ (light novel adaptation of the same name). She stands out more as generic sword fighter with skills to operate a mecha. We don’t find out much about her until later in the show but from the surface, she’s saturated with generic characteristics. Then, there’s Meteora, an intelligent NPC with a dry sense of humor. I honestly can’t remember the last time I ever laughed at her character just because of how diehard this show attempts to make her entertaining. On the other hand, the show has other characters such as anti-hero Yuuya, the noble knight Alicetaria, mecha pilot Rui Kanoya, magical girl Mamika, and former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. These characters all have their own stories although among them, Blitz is probably the only one that I found truly interesting. That’s because the motives of these characters really feel flat and uninspiring. I mean, a noble knight trying to get revenge for a fallen friend. I’m sure you’ve heard that somewhere before. Still, there are two characters that kept me interested throughout the show. Those are Magane Chikujouin and the Military Uniform Princess. Why do these two intrigues me the most? It’s because both of them make their own luck and destiny. Magane is a highly unpredictable character with a devious personality. She is very sarcastic with a dangerous ability. What sets her apart is that she is on her own side throughout the show and seems to play along the story like a game. Meanwhile, the Military Uniform Princess is by no shadow of a doubt the most mysterious character in the show. Her motives from the start is very unclear and most of her dialogues spoken in this show seems to have some sort of hidden message. She also seems to have some sort of connection with Souta but that remains a mystery throughout a decent amount of this show. So perhaps in many ways, these two characters create spectacles as viewers try to anticipate their role from the story.<br />
<br />
At its core, the creators and created play the main role although I can’t really say that I’m impressed by the character relationships. They just seem all over the place and almost none of them really feel special. The show attempts to make us feel something for the characters whether it’s their personalities or motives. Yet as I watched more and more of this show, I can’t really say that any of them are particularly memorable. At times, I thought this show was trying to make us sympathize with the characters. However, I really felt nothing for the characters. Even Selestia, one of the main female protagonists didn’t stand out as the show didn’t develop her enough as a character. She just seems to be there to play her role as a female fighter. The main male protagonist, Souta is far from interesting from any angle. The only time he ever drew my attention was during his interactions with Magane and it’s when she’s the one doing the talking. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the story shows some promise as it ties together the characters and their roles. The background story of Souta is perhaps one of the more interesting and also most important part of this series. As a very talky show with heavy exposition, each episode does build more and more of the story together to avoid loose ends. When you mix so many genres together all at the same time, it can be quite difficult to tie everything together. Yet, somehow this show does manage to achieve such a feat when its storytelling manages to be convincing despite being predictable. That’s of course speaking from the first half of the show. From the latter half, I can’t really say the story is impressive. It bobbles down to exploring events from previous relationships and how that influences character motivations in the present. Certain new characters introduced in the latter half really feel out of place like as if they are just there to make the story flow more. However, it really felt unnecessary and just make the series longer than it should’ve been. <br />
<br />
You’re probably thinking: “Oh but you can enjoy this show if you don’t take everything so seriously and accept the story more openly!” That would be the case if the comedy of the show didn’t come out as so dry. The jokes in this show often feel forced and mixed with a dry sense of humor. Meteora is probably the guiltiest of this as her character personality demonstrates this throughout the show. There are also occasional adult humor-like jokes thrown in at random and otaku references that just comes out as flat. On the other hand, the action and choreography is well made. When making original anime, Troyca seems to pour a decent amount of effort to make their work look like an action flick.<br />
<br />
Well, I guess I’ll admit it. Re:Creators’ animation quality as a whole looks solid on multiple fronts. From the battle choreography to character designs, everything seems to fall in place in order. The characters from the fictional worlds look creatively unique that suits with their role. Even the mecha designs has its dynamic features that avoids CGI pitfalls. The most innovative design that had my eyes glued to the screen is no doubt the Military Uniform Princess. I’ve rarely seen a character with such a look and that really took my attention. Unfortunately, the other fictional worlds didn’t get too much spotlight as we only see glimpse of them. The majority of the show takes place on Earth and we all know how dull that is. Nonetheless, Re:Creators succeeds at crafting its visual elements through its character designs, action sequences, and world fiction.<br />
<br />
Unless you’ve been living under a rock in recent years, then it’s obvious that the soundtrack of the show is created by the modern talent of Sawano Hiroyuki. The OST is stellar with its dramatic choreography and precisely timed. The OP &amp; ED theme songs are very catchy with hidden messages. Character voice mannerisms are also memorable in particular with Military Uniform Princess, Magane, and Meteora. <br />
<br />
In the end, Re:Creators is a mediocre a show that tried far too hard to make itself look cool. By mixing a variety of genres, I expected a show to capitalize on them. Instead, what I got is a show that relied far too much on its characters to do the storytelling. And that ended up being a risk taken with little reward. In many ways, this show can be recommendable to people if you’re looking for some fun action and typical fictional story. Just be aware that it’s also very talky with exposition. The comedy is very mixed depending on perspective. For me, Re:Creators wore itself out almost like a meme.<br />

    I believe I mentioned this before, but I find it consistently harder to write in praise of an anime than to bash it, to the point that the only manner in which I could be satisfied on doing so, would be to break down each episode while highlighting why I believe certain scenes or bits of dialogue are so great and important to the big picture. As you can imagine, the highest I value something, the harder it feels to explain, so let it be known right from the start: I do see Re:Creators in VERY high regard!<br />
<br />
Story and Characters<br />
<br />
To begin to understand why the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258078">
        show works so well, the first good hint would be the original writer, Rei Hiroe, who wrote the story that led to the anime. For those unfortunate enough to not know who Hiroe is, he’s the author of the Black Lagoon manga and the responsible for the dynamic between Rock and Revy, two of the finest characters crafted in the media. In Black Lagoon, he demonstrated his strength at crafting witty and meaningful character studies, while in Re:C he displays, with some aid from Ei Aoki (director of Fate/Zero), his efficiency at developing cohesive, effective and strong plot.<br />
<br />
Some comparisons I’ve seen be made about the nature of Re:C in regards to other anime vary from a knock-off of Fate/Zero’s concept, for those who see the combination of colorful fighters of multiple origins as somehow related to F/Z and nothing else, to a shallow piece of propaganda fellating the Japanese government and military, in the same fashion as GATE, for people who are too obtuse to notice the obvious differences and like to make asinine comparisons (you know who you are!). The closest I’ve seen to actually hit the mark was to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, since both works are commentaries on the media they’re a part of. This comparison doesn’t adequately prepare you to get into Re:C, but it is a better assessment of the nature of the show. While Haruhi is purely a dissection (or you might even say a “deconstruction”, if you can believe it) of the tropes that are to this day prevalent in anime, that made itself brilliant by twisting the role of the protagonist and titular character, along with the ones that personify those tropes, Re:C is a commentary on our relationship with fiction, both from the perspective of the creators as well as the audience, and it makes itself brilliant by making what would be natural parts of that relation into integral, tangible elements of the plot. I’ll discuss the perspective a bit more when we get to the characters, but for now let’s talk about the strength of the narrative<br />
<br />
Besides characters, which I consider to be the most important thing in a story, something I also find of great importance when analyzing is how well structured is the narrative. That takes into consideration things like pacing, as in the rate in which the story progresses or new information is introduced, the role different characters play and how meaningful they are on that role and, specially, when things happen for a reason. Re:Creators shines in that regard, among other reasons, because it wastes almost no time. Every episode in this show is there for a reason (yes, even the hot-spring episode) and nearly EVERY scene has something to help bring out new information, develop the numerous figures of the cast or reinforce what is already known, character and narrative-wise, through a new method or situation. Want an example? The events of episodes 9 and 10, for once, might seem to have no effect in the rest of the plot, at first glance, but looking closely you might notice that they made for the perfect set-up for the main characters to confirm a plot point that would prove itself vital for their future plans, as well as kick into motion Aliceteria’s character-arc. Take this episode out of the equation and you’ll have that plan turn into a complete ass-pull and have Aliceteria’s change of heart be completely unwarranted.<br />
<br />
If you are reading this review, I’d assume you already know the premise of Re:C, so I’ll not waste much time explaining it. So, a feeble mind would predict the main villains of a story with such premise to be those who were already villains in their original stories, but this is one of the instances where this anime subverts expectations in the best way: the real villain of the story is a character that originally had no purpose, while the one who was originally a villain turns into a wild card. The series tackles motivations and work ethics of the different artists, ranging from those who do that simply to make a living to those who see on the act of crafting a story as their way of expressing themselves in the way that is the most fulfilling. That said, let’s talk about the characters, starting with the main antagonist<br />
<br />
Altair, or the Princess in Military Uniform, was an original character, created based on one  of a preexisting fictional game called Eternal Wars Megalosphere and is noted from the beginning to be connected to Souta, one of the main characters, and Setsuna, a former friend of Souta who, and I don’t think I’m spoiling much about the first minute of the show, committed suicide a few months earlier. Do you want another example of how finelly crafted is the structure in this anime? Since not much is shown from Setsuna’s perspective prior to her suicide, some viewers might get frustrated at first, feeling that they missed on something important, but that turns out to be a necessary decision, given what we see from her on episode 21, in which her avatar plays a decisive role in the conclusion. This decision is a great factor into making the experience of this episode as meaningful and effective as it is, besides the excellent writing, of course. Altair was a character created without a set purpose, carrying only the emotions of her creator, to whom she feels a strong connection with. Therefore, she takes upon herself the task of avenging her creator, who she feels was wronged by the world. That lack of a reason to exist, coupled with the angst carried by the one she held the dearest led her to see the real world as a cruel story, and what better way to enact her revenge than by causing the world to implode on itself?<br />
<br />
Mizushino Souta, a highschool-age student, is part of the main cast, but regards himself and is treated by the narrative more as a narrator-type figure. He’s an aspiring illustrator who’s a bit shy about his art and holds a guilt complex in regards to Setsuna’s death, who he believes to have betrayed. He considers himself partially culpable for her suicide, for not coming to her aid when it was needed, and that feeling of guilt is what motivates him to take action during the second half of the story. The conclusion to his is arc is not one of overcoming the guilt, but of learning to shoulder the pain of his mistake and making something positive out of it, through his creations. Episode 21 (seriously, folks, it’s a very important episode) is where that is displayed at full force and he ultimately comes to peace with Setsuna. Souta also provides insight about the perspective of people who enjoy and avidly consume fiction, like on his argument with Aliceteria, where he tells her how characters like her are loved because they motivate people with an ideal, a model of how to act, to be honest and never let themselves be brought down by hardship. He also comments later how the passion for anime, manga and other media gives the viewer the opportunity to see the world through someone else’s perspective<br />
<br />
Starting the hoster of creations with the heroes, we have Selesia, a character from the light novel and anime series Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, an Escaflowne looking, magitech inspired Mecha that I like imagining to be set in phantasy 1920s. In her world, she was the partner of the main male lead, Charon, fighting against the forces of the Avalon Brigade, which gave her a resolute, quick to action personality, but still calm when among friends. In an interaction with Souta, she advises him to take his time and not try to rush his artistic development, because that way he would be able to grow appropriately along with his work. That interaction reflects the experience she had fighting in her universe, experience that also makes for amusing banter between her and her creator, Takashi Matsubara. Initially, she complains to him about why he didn’t make her stronger, not understanding his perspective as the writer. Their relation eventually becomes mildly like father and daughter, and Matsubara comes to be protective of her, cherishing her as his creation. He comments, during a conversation, how writing is his way of telling the world that he has been there, of leaving a mark on other people. He comes off as an experienced writer, who understands what he can and cannot do in order to keep the audience invested on his work.<br />
<br />
Next in the roster is Meteora, also known as Best Girl, originally a NPC from the RPG game AVALKEN of Reminisce, where she takes the role of a powerful mage and the responsible for the library at the End of the World, right before the final boss. This is a very important detail about her, because it influences the way Meteora relates to the real world and other creations, as well as fiction. She states early on that her world is deeply detailed and fleshed out, having even fiction of its own, therefore she has better appreciation and understanding than other creations have about art, its mechanics and the influence it has over people. Interestingly, in one of the early episodes, she and Selesia contemplate a graffiti, and while Selesia has an amazed look on her face, Meteora displays a colder, more analytical expression, denoting the difference in impact for both of them. Lacking social interaction but being remarkably intelligent, she doesn’t have an easy time expressing her emotions properly, which she tries to mitigate by pulling off horrible puns. We see more of that restrained playful soul in episode 13, the greatest recap episode in the history of anime. A nice, detail about her character is how initially her speech is notoriously long-winded, but over time it’s possible to notice it becoming less prolix and more personable. Her knowledge of fiction allows her to read effectively into other characters and she quickly learns to understand what goes through the heart and mind of people from the real world, making her the one to give Souta the emotional support he needs to come clean about his mistakes and deal with the guilt that torments him. She is definitely the one the boy feels the most confortable to talk to, and their friendly chemistry persists throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Hell, I ship them!<br />
<br />
Since she becomes the brain of the group, fact amusingly displayed when nobody knows what to do and quickly turn to look at her, Meteora also develops a professional friendship with Kikuchihara, the government official responsible for dealing with the situation of the fictional characters. Both recognize and grow to respect each other as the one from both groups who knows best how to deal with the situation<br />
<br />
Mirokuji Yuuya is every anti-hero/rival voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto: impetuous, self-reliant, prideful, hedonistic and occasionally clever. Funny enough, his rival from his original story, Sho, is himself voiced by Okamoto, which might be the most amazingly subtle reference ever. Both come from Yatoji Ryou’s manga Lockout Ward Underground: Dark Night, with Yuuya being laid-back and uninterested in doing what others tell him, hanging out with the heroes simply for the fun of fighting the villains, while Sho is obsessed with killing Yuuya, whom he believes to be his sister and best friend’s killer. Perhaps mirroring Yuuya’s personality, Yatoji is arrogant and a bit difficult to deal with, but softens up fast due to their dire situation. He and Matsubara worked together in the past and don’t go very well with each other, but it’s hinted that Matsubara appreciates Yatoji’s work and still worries about him being able to continue, as shown when Yuuya decides to beat up his own creator.<br />
<br />
By now we had the light novel female warrior lead, the RPG kuudere, the adolescent power phantasy and fujoshi bait, it’s time for our Gundam boy. Yes, Kanoya is the “Gundam” representative; he went looking for some young poon-tang on his first week in the real world, so he cannot possibly be the Shinji look-alike. His author, Nakanogane-san, wrote him to be someone who gets easily defensive, but also quite heated-up in battle, but as soon as he comes to the real world, the kid decides he doesn’t want to fight anymore. What? Did you expect the Gundam kid to not have his “get in the robot” moment? Silly you!<br />
<br />
Kanoya’s small but charming character arc involves him realizing that the obligations he shoulders in his original world are not arbitrary, but something that only he as the protagonist can fulfill, which gives the kid newfound sense of responsibility. His conversation with Souta in episode 11, while superficially seeming like just a fine motivational moment, also highlights an important part of creating effective stories: that characters need to have a purpose to guide their development and actions, creating a sound narrative. Nakanogane-san doesn’t have trouble finding his place, though. The creators here don’t just sit around while their characters fight to save the world: they take initiative on putting together the pieces of Altair’s past and goals to find the best course of action.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there’s Hikayu, the visual novel heroin created by Nishio Ohnishi (har har!), who’s a pervert. A good-hearted one, don’t be too harsh on the guy, he means well. Since her game of origin was primarily an eroge, Hykayu is disheartened to learn how exposed she’s to the world, which makes for some of the best comedic moments on the show, like when she does her badass entry during the heat of the combat, shouts her passionate entry lines, while feverishly blushing in shame of her outfit. Surprisingly, or maybe not, her game is not exclusively made of fap material and contains emotional moments that she carries over to her experience in the real world. Could this be a tangential commentary about the tastes of the stereotypically perverted otaku, who can accept a story having blatant smut as well as heartstring-pulling narrative? Perhaps a jab at how we feel the need to justify liking questionable material with the argument that it has a serious and emotionally gripping story? Who knows, but it does add more substance and weight to the notion that the writers and staff do know the ins, outs and running trends of the media they are representing in the anime, instead of simply crafting half-assed references.<br />
<br />
Chikujouin Magane (creator not important) is the one creation to have been a villain in her story, but like Yuuya, prefers to act by herself and have fun with people’s suffering. She takes quite the liking or the real world and for Souta’s emotional struggle, taking him and the creations as her main source of enjoyment for the first half of the show. She doesn’t seem to like Meteora very much, though, since the girl doesn’t fall easily for Magane’s mind tricks.<br />
<br />
On Altair’s side, the first ones to appear are Aliceteria, the idealistic knight, and Mamika, the unlucky Magical Girl.<br />
<br />
Mamika comes from a show for kids, where the morality is black &amp; white, villains are recognizable at first glance, good people who don’t immediately side with the heroin just need to be beaten into agreement and violence is bloodless, so for her it’s a shock to learn that in this new reality her powers might inflict serious harm on people. Kind-hearted and naïve, she doesn’t so much change her nature as the series goes on, but instead learns about the complexities of the new world and takes different methods to bring end to conflict. Aliceteria, in the other hand, comes from an equally black &amp; white reality, but one severely more violent, bloody and harsh than that of Mamika. Aliceteria is stubbornly idealistic, to a point where the anime makes it clear she fooled herself into believing the real world is really a home of sadistic, cynical gods, who created her reality just to amuse themselves with the suffering of the people in it, so it’s her duty to force her god, Takarada-san, to fix her world and free it from evil. Takarada himself looks like a young, emergent author who still hasn’t mastered the creation of layered and complex characters, relying on the archetypical noble hero to focus his work on. It’s partially through Souta’s intervention and passionate speech about why figures like Aliceteria are beloved on his world that she begins to realize how disconnected she is from the true motivations of her fans.<br />
<br />
Mamika and Aliceteria form a strong bond in their short time together, despite the difference in mentality. For once, when going to recruit a new creation, Mamika hopes it’s a good person, while Alice hopes it’s someone trustworthy and strong (to their dismay it’s neither), and it’s the similarity in values, despite the difference in priority, coupled with the courage and backbone that warms the knight to the young magical girl.<br />
<br />
These two characters, among others, help put into perspective one of the brilliant ideas applied on Re:Creators: the anime purposefully built one-dimensional characters into the narrative because in context they come from stories that aren’t as well fleshed out or detailed. Selesia and Meteora, were created by authors who intricately crafted their personalities, worldviews or universe, so when they come to the real world they act more human, but also can better understand the morality of their creators, while Mamika and Alice were shallow characters, created to be good and righteous, but lacking understanding of complex notions of right and wrong, so they become easy prey for a villain who can spout ideas that sound good and presents easy solutions to their problem. That shallowness is not the final state for them either, but a jumping point from where they develop into layered and intelligent individuals capable of understanding the new reality and taking the best decisions based on their own morals.<br />
<br />
Lastly, because going further would be spoiler, there’s Blitz Talker, the hard-boiled supporting character from the manga Code-Babylon, written and drawn by Suruga Shunma. Blitz clearly knows of Altair’s true intentions from the beginning, but stays with her because of his desire to protect her, whom he sees as weaker than she lets transpire. Suruga is an intriguing character because she keeps a low profile most of the time, not showing much of her personality and mindset. Most of the time she comes off as an aloof workaholic, constantly drawing, barely taking her eyes off the paper, only to look woefully uninterested when she did, but in her confrontation with her Blitz, she delivers plenty of substance. She makes for a great parallel to Setsuna. The girl had a sudden boost in notoriety, but didn’t have the time to grow up and learn to deal with the hate that comes with the spotlight and that negativity was too much for her young mind to deal with. Suruga, on the other hand, had to struggle with competition and criticism, suffered with the negativity, finally reaching enough success to be able to sustain herself with her art. Many viewers might think her outlook on fiction or her creative process is cynical, but it’s better to describe it as pragmatic and she shows to genuinely love and take pride on her work.<br />
<br />
On episode 03 the anime introduces the concept around which the entire plot revolves: audience acceptance. They first note that the characters to appear in the real world tend to be those who had the largest impact among the public, so after Matsubara fails to alter the description of Selesia, it becomes obvious that the creators can’t simply change their characters as they go along. They soon began to theorize that what can really affect their status is if they manage to get enough of the general public to empathize with the changes made to them, idea that is solidly proven in the events of episode 10. It’s based on that concept that the heroes elaborate their plan to defeat Altair, by crafting a story that would be able to gather acceptance from the public to the point where they are able to bait and trap Altair on the Bird Cage, a scenario located within the real and fictional words, where they’d be able to defeat her for good, with the approval of the public. Fun fact: Bird Cage is a reference to Altair’s name coming from the Arab word for bird.<br />
<br />
Looking at the contextual level it’s not hard to see that the idea of acceptance is a method of commenting on the common fictional elements that have the most success with the public on our own universe, as well as the difficulties faced by writers of popular works, who need to keep constantly in mind what the audience wants from them. Fiction is manipulation by nature, it’s designed to engage the audience in an illusion where the artist pulls the necessary strings to make us feel or think a certain way in relation to what happens to the characters. Bad fiction happens when the illusion is not convincing enough or when the trick is so poorly conveyed that we can see the strings in the background, and no character in Re:C exposes that better than Altair herself in the last few episodes. Not only are her powers the ability to manipulate the fabric of fiction (reason why she can’t simply nuke the world into oblivion), but her speech is constantly centered on the idea of what exactly pleases the audience and gets their acceptance. Her originally neutral condition also contributes to that concept: Altair is a character without cannon beyond the original powers given to her by her creator, so there’s little restraint for other artists to invent new abilities for her, as those new powers can just as easily get approval from the wider audience, contributing to her continuous growth in power and number of tricks up her sleeve. Part of me wonders if this is not a paradoxical trick the writer crafts with the audience. As the viewer, we are conditioned to expect the main villain to not go down until the very last moment, and only against a worthy hero that can pull off the strongest emotional reaction from the audience, therefore, the writers are fooling us into expecting Altair to pull off something new to aid her in battle, knowing that the nature of her powers allows for that.<br />
<br />
Presentation<br />
<br />
Across the multitude of designs presented the anime displays excellence in keeping verisimilitude and coherence. In fact, that might be the most valuable quality of the work’s presentation, beyond the technical aspects, which are not shabby by any means: the directing is excellent, packed with clever transitions and enthralling shot composition (special shout out to that one camera movement in episode 06 that tells us with no effort that Magane just gets it). <br />
<br />
Every element of character design was conceived in a way that the experienced anime fan could safely note what they make reference to: Selesia and Charon dress in the angular and colorful style that has become a trend among light novel characters, clearly made to please cosplayers instead of having practical combat utility; Meteora sports the distinguishable attire of an RPG mage from works like the Tales franchise, cuz the design is clearly too confortable to be Final Fantasy; Kanoya uses the slick, futuristic uniform of robot pilots across the Mecha genre. All of this is important because it says something about the characters, not only from what kind of story they come from, but also their personalities. Even when in civilian outfits, the choice of clothing tells something about them: Meteora dresses with cute and childlike attire, because she’s a petit woman and is tired of constantly using a thick uniform, while Selesia’s adorably modest choices help flesh out her personality as reserved, possibly chaste.<br />
<br />
The same care extends to all the fictional websites, products that appear on the show as well as the different magic symbols used by the characters. The designers commented in interviews how there was an entire creative process behind the elaboration of the multiple logos, focused on creating an internally consistent scenario. There’s no “Gaagle” search engine or “PZP” console in this story, all the fictional products, social medias or websites presented here were designed to look and sound believable to the extent that one could easily think that Mauchly, Piclive or Songbird are a real thing, or that SONY might actually create a console called Play Portal, which I imagine would be a portable with meager first and third-party support.<br />
<br />
The sound department continues the effort in verisimilitude by featuring performances consistent with the universe and genre each character comes from. I’ve already mentioned Nobuhiko Okamoto previously, brilliantly cast as Sho, not just because of the irony but also because he’s can skillfully express Sho’s devoted and naïve mannerisms. Other clever choices are Suzumura Kenichi as Yuuya, fitting since this voice actor has experience with characters who speak in mischievous tone, and Minase Inoue, as Meteora, who previously worked as Rem in Re:Zero and is capable of pulling off a character who speaks stoically without falling into blandness. Now, voice actors are a fun subject and all, but that’s not even the most exciting aspect of how Re:Creators sounds. That would be Sawano Hiroyuki’s amazing soundtrack, tailor made for this anime. Permeated with intense electronic beat and bombastic energy, these songs are never misplaced; the same track can mark the intensity of action sequences but also play to great effect in comedic beats, adding more points to the directorial work. Just look at Selesia trying her new power or Hikayu doing her badass entry and you’ll know what I mean. The lyrics, off course, in songs like Here I Am (Mamika’s theme), God of ink, Layers, Brave the Ocean and World Etude are perfect mirrors for the characters inner thoughts and their goals. <br />
<br />
Personal Ramblings<br />
<br />
I first thought about talking about this in the story breakdown, but I decided to leave it for this section, as it is the main reason Meteora became my favorite character in the show and why I began to see this anime with higher appreciation. In episode 04, after learning about the passing of her creator, Meteora decides to play her game on its entirety. Later, she confesses her main grievance from when she came to the real world and talked about her experience with her own game: it was fun, and that’s all that matters, because all she needed was to known if her creator loved her world the same way she did. This moment was particularly relatable to me because it reminds me of a book I’ve read long ago, The Hour of the Star, where the narrator talks about the protagonist of his story, and about how he loved her. Later is that I came to realize that such love was not a traditional sentiment, but the love of the artist for his creation. Meteora’s confession displays the inverse route, from creation to the artist, but to me it emulates the sentiment of the audience, the feeling of experiencing a work that had love put into it, where the people involved were truly invested in created something that would resonate with the player, the reader or the viewer.<br />
<br />
Re:Creators is an anime I never knew I wanted, but now that I have it I wonder if there’ll ever be something else like it. The way multiple aspects of artistic creation are talked about and analyzed, the portrayal of the audience and Souta’s mindset as a passionate consumer were all relatable and the show frequently would surprise me by doing something I already expected, but in a way that I did not imagine. Rei Hiroe’s writing tends to do that.<br />
<br />
I sure hope there’s more originated from it, off course. The many works mentioned in the story might as well spawn new franchises in the future, now that they had the perfect introduction. I sure would love to see what they could make out of Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, since those who saw Re:C already know of some spoilers for it, or how they could conceive Mamika’s anime; perhaps as something initially childish-looking that progressively gets more serious and multifaceted. I know Mecha is in life-support nowadays, but it would be nice to see Infinite Divine Machine Mono Magia get its own anime too. The possibilities are not endless, but they sure are plentiful and can be fruitful as long as those works continue to have comparable quality of writing, directing and care put into them as much as it was put in Re:Creators. <br />

    Re: Creators is an awful but in the same time a unique series in a sense that it directly tells the viewers the reasons for its existence: the fact that hundreds of thousands of people can spend their time on and, most importantly, breathlessly enjoy and pay money for an ugly badly-written constantly fourth-wall breaking horribly directed nobody-on-the-staff-list-ever-cared pissing-on-the-other-shows pack of completely unrelated action scenes.<br />
<br />
When making an anime from some source material (manga/light novel), writers usually have trouble packing all the events in a video format. This is one of the reasons why so much shows are filled with exposition, scenes of characters thinking and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257715">
        other &quot;better off reading it&quot; elements. But for these types of shows, this is mostly forgivable. However, if an anime-original content is also a bunch of &quot;characters talking and narrating, doing essentially nothing for a few episodes straight&quot; it should probably be noted that writers never even cared. The calamity of nothingness is especially noticeable in the beginning of the second part of the show; these episodes are just characters talking around without any emotion.<br />
<br />
But even such a show can be, at some level, enjoyable. Not the case with this one. The moment you realize the true depth of never-even-cared storywriting is somewhere at the end of the series. The interactions happening among the characters become to be much like this: &quot;Your plan failed! Ahahaha!&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ll definitely bring you down!&quot; or &quot;You&#039;ve been deceived. I am the good guy&quot; - &quot;Oh, ok&quot;. And the problem is not the content of the phrases. The problem is that the characters&#039; interactions are narrowed down to this. And, as a result, the composition of the show essentially becomes an emotionless logbook of who did what.<br />
<br />
To be fair, the first half of the show looks a bit decent. Disregarding the fact that the first half of the second episode is already a pile of shameless exposition the things happening generally raise a certain level of emotion and tend to follow some logic. That is probably the reason why a certain someone declared this to be a &quot;classic anime in the making&quot;. And I should probably mention that a lot of people like the music. I generally enjoyed it. However, in my opinion it is really generic to the point where I can swear I&#039;ve heard ED 2 (especially 0:09-0:22) somewhere before. But I&#039;m no expert in music so I&#039;ll leave it at that.<br />
<br />
It should be noted the show is not redeemed by these few good things I&#039;ve just mentioned. To add to the point, this show also contains the usual trope that half of bad stuff wouldn&#039;t have happened if the characters just kept doing something very simple. Which they obviously don&#039;t do cause logic means no plot.<br />
<br />
Overall, Re: Creators is an overhyped quick cash grab made by people who never cared.

    Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley.<br />
<br />
What began it&#039;s descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening.<br />
<br />
This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249195">
        theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn&#039;t accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it&#039;s already ruined my immersion.<br />
<br />
Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it&#039;s all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won&#039;t get into it.<br />
<br />
If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there&#039;s more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that&#039;s for you to decide.<br />
<br />
The main character--I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he&#039;s hiding the information when it&#039;s need. That&#039;s why I say it&#039;s a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It&#039;s not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it&#039;s just poor writing.<br />
<br />
Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it&#039;s ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to.<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I&#039;ll give it credit where it&#039;s good but if a story is bad, it&#039;s not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you&#039;d like but know that I find this series lacking.<br />
<br />
Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.

    what happens when you bring your favorite anime character to our world. considering the copious amounts of shows where we have the opposite and we go to their worlds it&#039;s a little refreshing.<br />
<br />
the art is good but I don&#039;t really care enough because the show is mostly people sitting around talking and giving exposition. for the action scenes, we do see it is fairly original and fluid it is worth the sitting around.<br />
<br />
the music isn&#039;t that memorable to me but I like the casting choices. it feels like they belong with the characters.<br />
<br />
the characters are amazing, going in you may expect basic mainstream anime tropes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247072">
        but everyone feels alive and like they&#039;re their own person. they are very memorable and they do have their references to other characters from different stories but it was done right to feel as if it is not cliche. They have great reactions to the realization of the situation they find themselves in and seeing who their creators are, are they like gods they imagined or not. the main character doesn&#039;t add much as he is just around to tell us who the characters are as king otaku (not a stereotype btw)  but I guess it&#039;s useful knowledge.<br />
<br />
the story is great but it&#039;s too much say and not do. like I said before its 90 percent sitting around talking in one room and that can be boring and for a lot of people is. I am really into this show for I don&#039;t know if I can handle it for 22 episodes from my history with anime I will get bored and I hope we get a little more movement at least. Otherwise, I love this show and want it to improve. i want more show and not tell<br />
<br />
i give it a 8 out of 10 the story is enough to keep you watching but don&#039;t be surprised if you want to skip through at points.

    &quot;Being predictable is a sign that the show isn&#039;t amazing. It was an interesting ride that ended in an unexpected way.&quot;<br />
<br />
****Personal comment: Original the score was 8.0 due to all the complaints from certain individuals and the unhealthy criticism about my incoherent score and my review I changed the score to 6.0. However, after consideration I thought, it is my review. ReCreators has several issues as I explain but I liked several parts of the anime so who cares. I thank all the persons that found and will find this review helpful****<br />
<br />
A reunion between fictional creations and a real world was possible in Re: Creators.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257659">
        A show with a high potential and entertainment. Sadly, it didn&#039;t fulfill all the expectations and could pass in the history as another predictable anime with a good art quality and a wasted character development.<br />
<br />
In the end, we will get a final that won&#039;t fit with all the sacrifices, characters descriptions, mature story progression but will please the fans.<br />
<br />
Score 7.6--- rounded 8.0. A story with plot craters and constant pacing change. The anime has some great parts. For example, the characters background, art, and sound. As several persons said to me, good art quality and sound can&#039;t save all the plot failures explained above but tastes are tastes, I liked it, yes could have been better. <br />
<br />
Story: 5.5 (Plot holes, predictable, average ending, waste of character building)<br />
Art:9.0<br />
Music: 9.0<br />
Characters: 7.0 (One of them have unexplained holes --&gt; Altair).<br />
Enjoyment: 7.5 (Lack of right pacing, predictable, waste of great value characters, average ending). <br />
<br />
The story: The world is full of stories, we have fictional heroes, villains, all kind of characters. One day some creation (Altair) was able of transcending the fictional world and became a part the real world. She was full of hate and rage since her creator suffered and suicided. Altair couldn&#039;t accept this. She wanted revenge. She intends to destroy the reality. To achieve this small goal, she decided to move other fictional characters to the real world and convince them to help her. Nice, right?<br />
<br />
This story was very refreshing. Sadly, the authors filled it with several holes that could be compared with the surface of the moon. They failed to explain &quot;how&quot; Altair appeared in this world in first place. If Altair was near to be omnipotent, she didn&#039;t need the help of anyone, she could have waited for more acceptance, and in her, near Goddess state, she could have destroyed all the reality.<br />
<br />
No matter these RIDICULOUS conclusions the show is very predictable. In episode 11 you can start guessing how this is going to end and that is a sign that the story isn&#039;t refined. Furthermore, a narrative full of holes and with a lame explanation from the authors.<br />
<br />
For example, the nowhere illogical &quot;hole fill&quot; from a metaphysic event. The character has an essential background. If the creator omits information, it is restored or added by an unknown event that fixes plot holes. Will you believe that silly explanation from the authors? They didn&#039;t have a creative way to explain their concept mistakes, and they only say &quot;it is a blank character and the rest of the background information was added by (add an imaginary event here).&quot; (Hiroe gave a similar explanation in an interview)<br />
<br />
Also, the authors failed in creating an appropriate pacing. The first episodes are slow and tedious. We end listening bricks of information, seeing the same place and the same office, etc. We can &quot;build&quot; the characters with the motion that&#039;s why is called &quot;animation.&quot; Let&#039;s not mistake creating a character background with a simple rhetorical conversation. In other words, they ignored the motion in the first episodes. In the end of the series (17 - 22) the pace improved, but they rushed a bit. In general, the speed isn&#039;t appropriate, reduces the enjoyment, and increases the series drops.<br />
<br />
The characters are the redeemable part of the series. Wistfully,  most of them are DISPOSABLE (even if we don&#039;t want to accept it). Some have a great background and build, few are annoying. They spend time developing them but, the authors have the bright idea of killing the most interesting characters. I know, it is right under certain circumstances (that change the central story core DIRECTLY), but they killed them in a way to maintain the spectators in front of the screen. Since the beginning, we can guess the solution and the creator of it. The other characters aren&#039;t needed for it.<br />
<br />
The main character, Souta. I read a lot of complaints of Souta (including the series lover ones). Who is Souta? A character that wasn&#039;t well developed and that evolved. He is annoying in the first part of the story, and at the end, he is having more guts than most of the heroes. That was sarcasm.<br />
<br />
About Altair, I like that villain a lot, but her character has several holes. The authors never give her an appropriate background. She is a pool of emotional disparity. Some persons will consider her a villain others a disturbed overpower person. It is funny seeing persons saying that she is an &quot;angel.&quot; Do not make me laugh. It is like seeing Freeza petting a cat or saying that Light&#039;s actions from Death Note were right.<br />
<br />
Altair&#039;s powers, they do not have any context or background. The only way to explain her powers is saying &quot;a secondary creator added that power&quot; and contradicts the &quot;audience acceptance&quot; explanation from the whole show. All this mess created a lot of debate in the social media. Besides, all the discussion generates a never-ending loop. It is better not trying to explain this deep hole because we can&#039;t.<br />
<br />
There are some wasted characters, for example, Magane. From my perspective, this character could have been the worst villain and one with the greatest potentials around. The writers added her to explain &quot;why certain ideas worked&quot; and concluded her original background and built. Same for Meteora, a character that ended as a vessel that only activates events. <br />
<br />
The other main character Selestia. She ended as a secondary filler with an &quot;expendable&quot; sign on her forehead. What can I say, she is the &quot;real&quot; heroine here. The authors again erased the background, her reason for existence and failed. All her character development was flushed (spoiler alert) in an explosion. A total waste that explains us the disposable concept here. Selestia is another victim that will die for the sake of the rating.<br />
<br />
The remaining characters are for entertainment, and we couldn&#039;t see their story developed. Now we have more questions than answers.<br />
<br />
Example of debates: If Altair has several alternate versions, the other favorite characters will too and are more familiar. Some persons will say &quot;but her creator died, that&#039;s why she can get powers from other creators.&quot; &quot;She has the Holopsicon.&quot; Someone else will answer: Magane and Meteora&#039;s authors died too, and they aren&#039;t that overpowered. Even if she has the Holopsicon that doesn&#039;t explain HOW she appeared in the world. Pipe: Matsubara could give a copy of the Holopsicon to Magane or Meteora. He already created a copy of Altair so giving the Holopsicon to them isn&#039;t hard. The never-ending-loop. A simple explanation that shows us the lack of attention to the details from the writers. That&#039;s why we see narrative and plot holes every time.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the characters have a significant development and background. However, the authors failed to make most of them essential for the story. For example, remove Selestia. You will conclude that nothing will change if she isn&#039;t there, the main story will end in the same way. Additionally, they didn&#039;t try to fix the &quot;background and plot holes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound. It is good, the mix between the score, the fights are well made, and they did a marvelous work. About the songs, the OP1 and ED1 were part of the Oricon Jpop and Jap Billboard rankings for 2 - 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
The art is stunning compared with other series from the season. The fights maintain a high quality. They use an extensive palette color and design that changes from character to characters. A plus because the characters came from different worlds. In general, the art was well made. Maybe the budget didn&#039;t allow them to have a better motion in the first episodes.<br />
<br />
Finally, the show is predictable, and that&#039;s a negative aspect. There are some great parts, but the lack of a smooth motion in the first episodes and the plot issues will lower the enjoyment. No matter these problems the show can offer some entertainment. In the end, you will have some fun, but you will think that they could change some parts for a better result. You will conclude, Re:Creators isn&#039;t amazing and that they wasted a great potential in a show that could have been a masterpiece.

Creativity is something to be cherished, at least when it&#039;s not used for malicious intent. Creativity is part of the soul of all good stories, and even the most generic, lifeless trite has at least something creative to call its own, for better or worse. Creators of fiction create their own worlds, characters, situations, etc., and exploring what would happen when their creations transcend fiction and leap into the realm of reality is, well, one of the most creative premises ever conceived in fiction, inevitable puns aside. However, premise draws is to a show, but execution is what keeps us away or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257690">
        coming back, happy, disappointed, excited, or enraged. Luckily, this show actually knows what it&#039;s talking about, giving a real reason to stay invested every time it slows down. It&#039;s a fascinating show, to say the least, and I love it, blunders and all, thanks to its wonderful intrigue, character interactions, fights, and designs. Is this the best show of the year, certainly not, but it&#039;s damn good. It&#039;s going to be rather hard to make my review as meticulous as this show is, given that this review is probably the hardest I’ll ever make, but I’m willing to try, thanks to the power of taking notes for this wonderful show. <br />
<br />
So as I reach my proverbial hand, I ask you two things: will you join me on this magical journey, and do you have any questions? Hopefully, you said yes to both of these, but I will certainly never know. Regardless, provided that your question is one that this review can answer, let’s find out, shall we?<br />
<br />
This series glorifies the audience, treating them as actual gods. After all, our reception of a show, on the whole, is what determines its success, and so do our wallets, especially our wallets. We determine a show’s success by watching it and decides to spend money on it. This series knows that so it assumes that we tend to only do that for quality shows. Hence, it makes sure that each of the fictional stories these characters are pulled from are from series that many people in-universe find to be of good quality. It expects that we only watch the good stuff or at least support what we consider good. This isn&#039;t entirely true for real life audiences, but it&#039;s nice to see a show treat us so kindly as a whole. It also pays special attention to detail with audiences. It doesn&#039;t just show perfectly accepting and cheering audiences like all other series that have fictional audiences do, it even shows some that are very perceptive, saying stuff like “that&#039;s our writer, classic him” or even “man, haha, this is so stupid” which many of us are definitely like, especially myself. <br />
<br />
The series also downplays the power of creators. We’d like to think that they can always have full control over their stories and change them up on a whim, and thus assign them all the credit or blame. That simply isn&#039;t true, and the show knows this. It shows they you can&#039;t just revise a product and expect that to fly with the audiences, you need to add something that will work instead of changing things to something already established. Sometimes there are many writers that have to come to some kind of agreement or end up dealing with what other writers wrote down before them. I know this show didn&#039;t the to show the executive meddling side of things but that happens too. Characters try to get their creators to make massive changes and that doesn&#039;t work for the reasons mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I love how there are certain story actions that only certain characters end up doing. Of course, Selesia ends up having a minute long dialogue about why she’s doing what she’s doing in her big combat scene in episode 19, she’s a character of a Light Novel adaptation. Of course, Rui with his mech has to be the one to kill someone he cares about who is in another mech. Have you seen Gundam? Of course, he gets a plastic model kit for his robot. Again, Gundam. <br />
<br />
There here is some great foreshadowing here at play too. We get great foreshadowing as to why Sota refuses to tell anyone about Altair’s creator when they need to know and he already knows, he feels horrible about what happened to her creator, Setsuna, since he wasn&#039;t there for her when she needed some semblance of emotional support. Setsuna being a character in episode 20 for the show they were doing to take down Altair? Sota pinned the idea a few episodes back and they thought it would be a crazy and controversial move (turns out it was but they made a cover story). Charon being an antagonist? Marie flat out told this to Selesia back in episode 3, unaware that this was the anime adaptation version and not the original novel version, where she was betrayed.<br />
<br />
The pacing in this anime is really slow, like, Ergo Proxy levels of slow, but that&#039;s ok. The dialogue in this show is almost always necessary because it&#039;s slowly but surely feeding us more important information about the world or exploring the themes via the characters interacting with each other and their stories in some way. Almost never is a scene remotely wasted, and in fact, they probably should&#039;ve added a few scenes about the spinoffs leading into the big gargle so that some of the reveals don&#039;t come off as asspulls because of them needing to do something and saying “well, the characters told each other about this and you knew these were a thing so it&#039;s ok”. Maybe part of the spa scene in episode 16 could&#039;ve been taken out for that but it&#039;s more than just the plot dragging its feet like what some may claim.<br />
<br />
Of course, I can&#039;t spoil the series without talking about how it all ends. Think back the whole Setsuna episode 20 deal. This was the perfect way to beat Altair, as well as a very creative one. Altair had always felt resentment over how Setsuna’s fate went thanks to the ridicule she received upon the creation of Altair. Using this to their advantage was a brilliant move by Sota. Of course, most OP end villains are defeated through the hero becoming insanely strong and then killing them or otherwise sealing them up completely, but here, she&#039;s convinced and consoled dialogue, dialogue between her and the one she cared about, as their last resort, and none of it came off as anti-climactic. After all, this was the end of Altair’s character arc, resentful of the world for what it did to Setsuna and now finally meeting her and then finally relenting in everything. <br />
<br />
With the remaining creation characters sans Magane and the characters that died (or basically allowed themselves to reside at the end of the story at the end of episode 21 meant to contain Altair), we see everyone give their final goodbyes and move forward. Barring Meteora (and the ones above), the rest of the creations say goodbye to their creators and head back to their worlds with the kind of banter you&#039;d expect from them and their relationships with their writers, and everyone heads off to their old lives again, with new projects and anime adaptations in the works. Thus, we come back to Sota and Meteora, who submit their scripts and we see the title one last time, with every creation sans Altair just hanging out in a drawing. We now see the anime adaptation of the show Selesia was in end, in a way that seems like she’s giving encouragement to the audience, so by extension, Sota Nearly brought a tear to my eye with how great that ending was. <br />
<br />
Of course, this narrative isn&#039;t perfect. Even excluding some problems mentioned earlier, the series can really beat us over the head with the whole “creator” and “audience acceptance” bit and it can feel borderline pretentious towards the end at times. There are holes regarding Sota’s seemingly absent mom and the idea that he goes to school but we never see him go to school. We have no idea how Altair managed to become sentient let alone get into the real world, and despite teasing us the connection between Altair and Sota, they never interact even once, which is honestly mind-boggling. The dialogue in episode 11 in particular can get intrigue given that no one makes a move in that episode’s fight until after 20 seconds of someone talking. There are also a few minor missed opportunities as well but honestly the surprisingly rickety narrative is still pretty rich.<br />
<br />
A large chunk of what made this show great comes down to two things: character dynamics, and the “creations” themselves. They, along with certain things I’ll get to in a bit, make this cast so great, despite the fact that they probably shouldn’t be. I’ll tackle some of the creators first.<br />
<br />
Sota is...interesting. A lot of people complained that he was weak and unable to do much other than support until the end, but that&#039;s kinda the point. He’s an ordinary kid surrounded by ordinary yet fully grown adults and epic badasses with superpowers. I doubt you can say that he can get much done without it coming off as forced and stupid. Sure, a ton of things revolve around him in some way or another, but he only gets to do something epic in the end, that writing Setsuna into the story to be the one thing that stops Altair, all for the purpose of telling her something he wishes he could&#039;ve told her while she was still alive. After all, he wasn&#039;t exactly a great guy before, finding some glee in her ridicule and not being there when she needed someone the most, all out of jealousy. It&#039;s this character arc that makes him so appealing, seeing him try to deal with what he had done, even if it meant hindering the group until someone broke the truth out of him, forcing him to accept it and bite the bullet for his team. Besides, while you can consider him the main character, don&#039;t. In episode 1, he actively states that above all else, he’s just the guy who gets to bring us into this world where he is one of many characters whose perspectives are largely shown. Regardless, he’s still a great character for what he is.<br />
<br />
The other creators don&#039;t get as of an ability to be memorable. I actively forget the names of most of them, though I do still like some of them, especially Suruga and to a lesser extent Matsubara, whose sort of snarky yet eventually caring father/daughter-esque relationship became really nice to see. I like seeing what happens to a creator emotionally when he sees his creation die, in that he feels like a family member of his died. The only creator I really can&#039;t stand is Nishio. He is the typical ultra perv character and to see him as a creator was disconcerting. Thankfully he gets the least actual plot significance because everything about this guy is insufferable. Back to what makes Suruga the best creator character: the scene with her and Blitz. This scene was epic, showing just how much she understands her characters and how she was eventually able to convince him to betray Altair. She even came prepared with a bullet-proof vest because she’s that awesome. <br />
<br />
There are now two non-creation characters to really talk about now: Marine and Setsuna. Marine draws some obvious Setsuna parallels in that she sometimes feels ridiculed and saddened by what she is passionate about yet proceeds to keep drawing, much like Setsuna did prior to suicide, and she almost always feels like when she tries to do something right, she ends up making things worse. That made it even better when she managed to give Selesia that fire sword attack in episode 10, which was already an epic moment. I&#039;ve already touched on Setsuna’s suicide and how I feel like there should&#039;ve been more seen on her end as to why she committed it but she was still an alright character, just a typical shy but mostly happy teen who became depressed at the harsh reality of what success can bring you. It&#039;s a shame we don&#039;t get to know much about her, but the scene with her and Altair was, again, incredible. Now, with that said, time to move on the real stars of the show: the creations themselves!<br />
<br />
The creations, the first 9 anyway, are what drive this section home. They are responsible for most of the best banter in the show and most of the exploration of these themes that to them, are very existential. Their personalities are also the ones that challenge and get challenged constantly, more so than any of the human characters sans Sota, though it&#039;s more of his past actions and hiding from them that get challenged rather than his personality and motivations. Some of them draw especially major parallels with certain characters from shows of our world, and I&#039;ll address major ones I see along the way. Welp, let’s dive right in.<br />
<br />
Selesia is easily my favorite of the bunch. From her character design to her overall immense beauty, to her expressions and overall character, I love her more than any other character in the show. She’s the first we see have to really be hit with the reality her she is a fictional character, and I find it really amusing that this is the anime adaptation of her exclusively, so she eldest know what happens later in the novels. She had one it the weaker personalities on the whole but that&#039;s where the banter and facial expressions come in. Her facial expressions, particularly those of the dialogue-heavy, yet casual situations, are always hilarious and I like how she ends up arguing with Matsubara a lot until the halfway mark, and how she reacts to some situations like the exact way Rui shot her down in episode 5 or how insufferable Nishio was being in episode 15. It&#039;s also funny to see that she refuses to read the novel of her or watch the anime because she feels it&#039;s awkward and embarrassing. It&#039;s a shame she had to die, but hey, what can you do?<br />
<br />
Meteora is an interesting one. I can understand her boring many viewers, as even in her game she was mainly exposition, and that carried over immensely, so that&#039;s an understandable trait of hers, but especially early on in the show, we see her being the one who drives the meta themes home, like about how she ended up really enjoying her game and shaking her view based on the passion put into her game by the now deceased creator, or how she still recognizes Sota as someone who played the game as the protagonist. The recap episode with her was uproarious though, seeing her find a way to diss anyone she can from this story and even come up with a crazy alternate scenario that results in her winning against Altair easily to end the story. Of course, it would be her bro hung up complaints from the studio itself and the fact that the recap episode was planned from the beginning. Of course, she’s the first one to really form a friendship with Kikuchihara given their similar personalities, and it&#039;s nice to see that at the end, she’s the only one that ends up staying to become a writer herself.<br />
<br />
Yuuya and Rui are the two of the 9 I have the least to say about to they get to share. Yuuya’s a fun jackass for most of the show and it&#039;s funny seeing him come up with a weird nickname for Meteora. The dude has no qualms about who he fights and probably more than most characters, Magane (who I&#039;ll really get to soon) repulses him greatly. As for Rui, he really draws a lot of parallels with Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam, especially at the beginning. Think about it: a whiny, angsty, blue-haired mecha pilot who grows into someone better over time. I wish I could&#039;ve seen the development instead of knowing that he came back a changed man, but it was nice seeing him and Yuuya become bros and seeing him try to encourage Sota to be less scared and emotional.<br />
<br />
Hikayu’s easily the weakest of the bunch, both physically and as a character. She’s very timid and eventually gets superpowers, and she does a little bit of moralizing, but she doesn&#039;t really have a strong presence or dynamic, let alone anything she really brings to the table other than some flashy moves and more fanservice. Then again, both of the characters that get introduced after the ⅔ mark are kinda lame, and we’ll get to the other one later.<br />
<br />
A common trait you&#039;ll realize about these characters is how complex and informed they are. They&#039;re of stories that aren&#039;t hellholes or black and white morality shows, so they get to be very complex and actually willing to be as informed as possible about his world and the nature of creators, unlike the antagonists. Before we get to them though, we have one last character to talk about.<br />
<br />
Magane is a complete wildcard, and I&#039;m probably not the only one who hated her for a while, for right and wrong reasons. She doesn&#039;t care about anything other than having fun, and she finds the struggle and suffering of others to be really, really fun, just like one of my favorite villains of all time, Terumi from Blazblue, especially when she manages to really bring Sota to despair by making him doubt his team and bring back his repressed guilt of not being there for Setsuna prior to her dear. She fucks with him especially hard, making it even more cathartic in episode 19 when he accepts that like her, he’s not exactly a good person (though he isn&#039;t as bad as she is). She challenged so many characters’ own morals and feelings, including the more black and white morality of characters such as Alice and Mamika. I initially grew to hate her mannerisms and eagerness to repeat a word multiple times before continuing her dialogue, but I grew to kinda enjoy her presence towards the end, especially when she helps out our heroes in episodes 19 and 20 with her reality-warping powers. With her out of the way, time to move onto the antagonists.<br />
<br />
Mamika is clearly the most sympathetic of the group since she’s a magical girl protagonist. This means that her morality is so black and white that she perceives those to some listen to her words of peace as bad guys. It&#039;s epic to see how the attacks that are usually fairly harmless and acceptable in her world cause massive hysteria and destruction in real life, causing her to panic and feel horrible. I especially like her relationship with Alice, as while they are from stories of polar opposite tones and moods, their ideologies on how they want to save the world and defeat evil are one and the same, and they bond over that in an almost sisterly fashion, making Alice want revenge for Mamika’s death. Then again, a magical girl with “Mami” in the name is pretty much destined to die, and both of these two characters die in their pursuit of heroism and saving the world, with Altair doing both of them in. This means I&#039;ve basically described Alice as well, unfortunately, but that at least saves me some time. There is one thing about her to mention though, her Saber parallels. Blonde blade wielder from a sort of medieval-esque origin, her pose and background in the first OP being like that one set of Saber standing in a bloody battlefield of swords and armor, her almost naïve sense of justice. You see it too, don&#039;t you?<br />
<br />
Blitz is also interesting. Out of the people working under Altair, he’s the only one exclusively from a manga, at least the only one explosively stated as such from what I understand. He knows he isn&#039;t some big hero, so he isn&#039;t manipulated by Altair from that perspective. He’s just doing what he can to assist her because he feels resentment over his writer’s narrative in which he’s forced to kill his daughter, who looks kinda similar to Nunnally from Code Geass (it&#039;s like they know me). He feels like he’s a failure as a father and he, again, knows he’s not some grand hero, so he finds it odd to see his comrades behave the way they do, and his payoff in episode 18 after the already glorious confrontation between him and Suruga, as I already mentioned is great. <br />
<br />
Altair is easily the best of the antagonists though. She’s as bitter as she is pretentious. She can manipulate everyone with ease and her powers are beyond broken. Some people say that&#039;s automatically a bad thing, to have a villain sue character (a villain who is OP and constantly winning), but in this case, it really isn&#039;t, for reasons I&#039;m about to mention. Despite the fact that she stands around too much, she’s always one step ahead for most part, especially in the second half when she uses the good guys’ main plan against them and slowly and sadistically picks them off one by one. Everything she does is for Setsuna, as she feels outraged by what the world did to her, which is an interesting motivation for a villain, as we can see her so vulnerable so many times and just have an epic emotional outburst that feels reasonable for everyone. And again, the way she is defeated was perfect.<br />
<br />
Chiron and Shou are also kinda weak and don&#039;t get much time to really be fleshed out, but I like the foreshadowing for Chirion being an antagonist all the way back in episode 3 as that he does all of this because he’s tired of the fighting and suffering. Shou just wants revenge for his family, which is a decent motivation too, and his powers are also cool as shit though, so both of these guys are at least better late characters than Hikayu.<br />
<br />
So, you can no doubt see two common traits with some of these guys here. Some of them feel absolute resentment involving their creators while others feel like this is their duty, but all of them sans Altair are woefully uninformed of the abilities of the creator, completely overestimating them. I also find it interesting that none of them are created as villain characters, just heroes and one character that adopted the role as the villain due to having no role and nothing but hate, when the only character created as a villain, Magane, is just a brutal wildcard. <br />
<br />
Again, it&#039;s not just the personalities that make most of these characters great, but far more so what they represent and their relationships with each other that make them stand out. Obviously, I didn&#039;t bother giving everyone, as not everyone is really worth mentioning, and some of these characters are still weak, so I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s an all-around fantastic cast, but even still, the better ones here are amazing enough to elevate everything to nearly reach that level anyway. They&#039;re about as good from a characterization and writing standpoint as they are from a visual standpoint on the whole, and speaking of which...<br />
<br />
TROYCA was the spearhead behind this ambitious show, and the characters look pretty good. The writers and other normal people look...exactly that, plain and ordinary. After all, they&#039;re mere mortals in this real world, nothing inherently special. The character designs of the true fictional characters are pretty good, and I am an especially big fan of the designs for Selesia and Altair. Selesia looks genuinely lovely no matter what outfit she&#039;s in (and she gets to be in a ton of casual outfits that look fantastic on her, so these guys either have great fashion sense or she’s generally just that good, but I love that they did that) and Alrair’s design is physically pretty complex and interesting, with the detailed suit and gauntlet and even the eyes with the red pupil and blue top of the iris and black bottom side of the iris, to the point where it&#039;s accepted in canon that she’s a pain for the team to animate (yet they never mess up, good on them). <br />
<br />
The character expressions (especially Selesia’s) can be real funny when they need to be and despite them all coming from different genres, their art styles all work perfectly here. The action is pretty fun as well, with no real fault in the choreography, though the camera is sometimes in the way. Still, these set pieces are really cool and fun and so are some of the powers, and there is a ton of flashy abilities on display here, and adds specific moments that look exceptional. The CGI can range from pretty decent such as Selesia’s mech which is a gigantic pain to name, to really bad, especially Shou’s CGI mecha knight-looking thing, though they&#039;re only used for the mechs and cars. Their designs can look decent though, like Selesia’s mech (again). There is an insane amount of dialogue so there are plenty of moments where there isn&#039;t a whole lot of animation happening, unfortunately, and the environments aren&#039;t interesting enough to hold our attention, so thankfully the character interactions and great Sawano OST for most part do that job just fine, especially in the first half. <br />
<br />
It is a commonly accepted belief that Hiroyuki Sawano is among the greatest anime music composers to date, with famously beloved OSTs for Guilty Crown, Attack on Titan, and Kill la Kill. This one is no exception and is one of the few actually good popular anime that he had the luxury of working on. There are a plethora of really good tracks for this show, including both versions of “Layers” and “Brave the Ocean” (though I much prefer the original over the MOD version for both). Many of these tracks are good enough to help bolster the enjoyment of the more dialogue-heavy scenes, especially for game-changing discoveries (such as the track “creator”) so you can imagine how well they work for the fight scenes. This Sawano OST isn&#039;t his best unfortunately, as while it&#039;s pretty good, it&#039;s highs aren&#039;t as epic as those of his AoT and Kabaneri OSTs, nor do they really match the Gundam Unicorn OST, which I feel is his best anime OST to date, even if tracks like &quot;Re:Suspense&quot; are up there and are still numerous. That should come off as less of a knock on the show and more of a testament to his musical prowess that great isn&#039;t one of the best.<br />
<br />
OP 1, &quot;gravityWall&quot; by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle &amp; Gemie is a very catchy and epic tune that really preps you up for this crazy ride you’re about to have, and one of the best OPs of the Spring 2017 season. OP2, &quot;sh0ut&quot; by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle &amp; Gemie, is even more epic and empowering, especially with the buildup before the now famous “Sawano drop” moment where after the epic build up, the song shifts into high gear. This is easily one of the best OPs of Summer 2017, and sometimes I struggle between choosing which of these two OPs is the better of the two, they’re both that good. ED1, &quot;NEWLOOK&quot; by Mashiro Ayano, while a decent song and ED in its own right, is a bit disappointing since many shows that Sawano did the music for bad both great OPs and great EDs, like Attack On Titan, Gundam Unicorn Re:0096, and last year’s Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The episode 13 ED, &quot;world Étude&quot; by Aki Toyosaki, is a bit better and I like that it’s the trailer theme from Altair’s planned series that was discussed in this show, but it&#039;s still only ok. ED 2, &quot;Rubikon (ルビコン)&quot; by Sangatsu no Phantasia, really grew on me. At first, I kinda thought it was alright and that what they did with the visuals was way better by it fits really well with everything and is a really nice and happy song in and of itself. I especially enjoy what they did with the visuals and the mixing of the show’s animated elements and different art styles with real life stuff, making it a really pleasant cross between everything it talks about. You kinda need to see for yourself how great and inventive it is. Overall, Sawano did another really solid job, as he’s known for, even if this isn&#039;t his most epic work.<br />
<br />
I had a ton of fun with this show, and the way it handled its ingenious premise. The dialogue was usually riveting, if a bit nervously heavy-handed at times, the characters, especially the “creations” were great, the foreshadowing and attempts at causing suspicion were great (especially for the reveals of Altiar’s creator and the fact that Chirion, Selesia’s best friend, was an antagonist), the comedy was almost always spot on and uproarious, and the fights were fun as hell. Again, a lot of people are gonna feel bored with this one, especially thanks to its slow yet necessary pace and the fact that it is infinitely more dialogue-heavy than we were initially led to believe, but the dialogue is almost always interesting for aforementioned reasons, and barring maybe the first half of episode 16, every scene is necessary, nothing is wasted, so despite it feeling like it drags at times, it almost never truly stalls. I like how it basically glorifies the audience as like a wrathful god that only likes good entertainment (we wish), even if the show sometimes feels like it has to hammer the point of some things home (probably out of fear, even though this backfired for many people). <br />
<br />
Back when this show was still coming out, I heard the mixed to negative reception of this show from many of my friends. Needless to say, I was beyond worried, and I began pleading for this show to be good. I am so released to say that I&#039;m not disappointed in the slightest. Re:Creators is anything but recycled garbage, it’s actually ambitious, interesting, and creative. Are there missed opportunities? Yeah. Is it heavy-handed and at times boring? Sure. Are there a few downright asinine aspects to this series. Certainly. That doesn’t stop how smart and epic this show is with its amazing premise or wonderful character interactions. This show kind of glorifies and expects a ton from you, which is charming in its own way. It’s in no way pretentious, but it’s more ambitious than most anime of this year, using so many kinds of tropes and characters from other genres perfectly and juxtaposing them with real life, as well as showing how a real setting that can allow for many more scenarios than a typical storyline for these characters can bring out so many different sides of them and incite some actual change from them. That makes it hilariously ironic given that this is a work of fiction though, and I’m not entirely sure if it’s aware of that or not. Even still, this is definitely one of the standout titles of the year, as it&#039;s a wonderful ode to creators and the work they put everything into. Now, as always, I bid you adieu.

    “I understand that this is a complicated world. I know that this isn’t the world where everything you wish will come true. But characters like me from stories, our purposes have already been decided and we can’t escape them. Unlike us, you guys can decide where you go by yourself. It might not be easy, but you can choose it and create it for yourself. You can write your own story just for yourself.” – Rui Kanoya. (Re:Creators)<br />
<br />
To be honest I had no interest in watching Re:Creators mainly due to the director Ei Aoki. despite him directing Fate/Zero which by the way was a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257667">
        show he also directed one of the biggest anime train-wrecks from this decade Aldonah Zero. It was a big disgrace to mecha fans that represent everything that is wrong with the mecha within 24 episodes.<br />
One month later of around may 2017 I decided to watch Re:Creators after hearing a lot of great things about it from my friends and fellow YouTubers.<br />
So is Re:Creators worth watching?<br />
Is this show is a classic or it just another forgettable anime?<br />
Let&#039;s answer that question, shall we?<br />
<br />
The story of Re:Creators follow Sota Mizushino who is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own light novel. One day while watching the anime adaptation of the mecha novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier to look for inspiration, the tablet that he was watching sputters and drags him into the anime world where he witnesses a battle between the anime character named Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning to the real world with a Selesia, Soon Sota discovers that other anime characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world with some of them aligned with the military uniform girl, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions.<br />
Now Sota and Selena must find the other characters and bring them home as well as defeating the military uniform girl princess who wants to bring untold destruction to every world that exists.<br />
I have mixed feelings about the story Re:Creators as it has a lot of good things in it but at the same time a lot of meh things.<br />
For starters, the show does a great job of introducing its cast of characters in a unique and clever way.<br />
The recap episode of the show was nice, very memorable and well written. I surprised they made a good recap episode because almost all recap episodes in anime due to how rushed they are and they only exist to add more episode count into a series.<br />
The shows tackle&#039;s themes of dreams, teamwork, understanding one another, creation, adapting and becoming a better person and for the most part, the show does well on exploring those themes. However, I will admit the show can be a bit preachy at times with its themes.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing you should note is that Re:Creators is quite a dialogue-heavy show especially in the first half which may tune off some people but I found the heavy dialogue to be pretty decent for the most part.<br />
Now we get into the show&#039;s flaws starting with slow pacing in the first half.<br />
Episode 1 was well paced but after that, the show slowed down to the point where most of the first half pacing moved at a snail&#039;s pace. I know the first half was meant to establishing its large cast of characters which the show mostly does a good job but at times the show moves way slow for an average viewer to handle and some people may get bored or drop the show because of it.<br />
It doesn&#039;t help the fact where half of the time the characters are all in one room just exposition stuff and events of the story Thankfully the second half is very well paced with very little hiccups.<br />
The second half despite being very entertaining and a step up in terms of writing was ultimately predictable. It doesn&#039;t help that show has a couple of plot holes and the authors themselves in the show just give a barebones explanation for the majority of the events<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters for Re:Creators I thought they were pretty enjoyable overall minus a few characters that I dislike.<br />
One thing to note that the show doesn&#039;t rely on the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
I honestly Sota was an okay character overall.<br />
Sure he can be whiny and a bit annoying at times but I thought he was a decent character overall who had decent character development in the second half.<br />
Now am going to talk about every creation character in the show starting Selena.<br />
<br />
Selesia is a badass female character who is very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked her interactions and her relation with her own creator Matsubara.<br />
<br />
Meteora is a book lover who likes to exposition about stuff.<br />
Some people may find her exposition to be annoying but for the most part, I found her to kinda tolerable despite her talking way too much at times.<br />
<br />
Yuya and Kanoya are cool characters and I really liked the characters interactions with each other despite them from being different genres. Also, they were pretty likeable.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick my favorite character in Re:Creators than it would be Mamika. She&#039;s a magical girl who doesn&#039;t know how things work out in the real world and she thinks everything is all colours and rainbows. After a few events that happened in the show, she evolves into a much better person who understands how the world works. She was the main highlight of the show for me.<br />
<br />
I never really liked Alicetaria due to her making stupid decisions left and right throughout the series. Her personality got on my nerves due to how preachy she is. If I had to pick the worst character in Re:Creators than it would be her because unlike Sota who actually became a decent character in the second half and had development she does the same annoying crap and she barely changes as a character.<br />
<br />
Magane is a pretty cool chaotic neutral character who is fun to watch on screen. That&#039;s about it really.<br />
<br />
Blitz is an okay character, okay but I will admit he got a bit better as the series went on after a certain event of the show.<br />
Hikayu and Shou are pretty fun characters, and I had no issues with them.<br />
<br />
Altair (Military Uniform Princess) is a pretty good villain overall and I liked her personally even tho she has a quite a bit of hole due to the authors not giving her a background and context of her powers.<br />
The rest of the characters are fine for what they are, and I had no issues with them.<br />
One thing that I liked about the characters were the creations relationships with the creators. Matsubara&#039;s and Selena relations is one of the main highlights from the show as the relations with keeps building up as they grow and change as characters as the show progresses.<br />
Another thing I praise the characters are the overall character interactions. Despite coming from different worlds and media, the creations can make great character interactions with one another or even start having good relations like for example Yuya and Rui. I much as I dislike Aliceteria her relation with Mamika was great as it triggers Mamika&#039;s character development.<br />
Now am going to address my the problems with the characters for Re:Creators. Most of them are underdeveloped.<br />
Characters, for example, Magane Meteora and Aliceteria, would be more interesting they had real character development instead of having no development or doing a half-fast one.<br />
(Spoiler Alert)<br />
Alicetaria was the Military Uniform Princess puppet through the series, and she was constantly fighting against Selesia, Sota and the other good guys even when after when Mamika was killed off. However, during a certain battle in the second half, she developed but moments later she gets killed by Military Uniform Princess aka Altair. How can anyone care for a character who was unlikable for the majority of the series becomes somewhat likeable in one moment than gets killed off? This is just bad writing here.<br />
(End of Spoilers)<br />
Now for my other problem. Certain characters talk way too much.<br />
As much I enjoyed the most of the heavy dialogue some of these characters talk way too much especially Meteora who never wants to shut up at times. It also doesn&#039;t help where half of the time of the first half they are all in a circle in one room and certain characters just talk their lungs out without giving the viewer to think<br />
Overall the characters are pretty enjoyable for that they were. However, I wished certain characters had character development instead of talking too much for a living<br />
<br />
Visually Re:Creators is pretty good for the most part.<br />
The character designs for the creations for each genre were great, and they portray the genre very nicely.<br />
The rest of the characters designs were pretty decent, and they are nothing to write home about.<br />
As for actual animation, it&#039;s pretty good with some well-animated fight sequences. However, it suffers from bad CG mainly seen from the last few episodes and to make my point there was a fight of Alicetaria and Rul were fighting and the show switched from good-looking 2D to shitty looking 3D in instant. I can understand why they attempted to do it consider the scenarios the characters that are in but having a character like Alicetraina who is primarily a 2D character then suddenly switching her in CG so she can fight the Rui CG mecha is just distracting. Least it&#039;s not Berserk 2016/2017 levels of bad CG.<br />
Overall despite having bad CG the show overall looks pretty good.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for Re:Creators is simply amazing and well-directed.<br />
All of the tracks were great it fits very well with each scene perfectly and it makes the show more enjoyable to watch. Also, the sound effects are just wonderful to listen as it blends in with the background music perfectly without it being distracting.<br />
The openings are fantastic amazing,<br />
The first opening theme gravityWall is a fast-paced catchy opening theme while the second opening Shout is just an epic song that fits the tone of the second half perfectly,<br />
Both ending themes are pretty good overall.<br />
The voice acting is top-notch.<br />
All the seiyuus did a wonderful job with roles and it makes the show more impactful.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this time of the review Re:Creators hasn&#039;t got a dub, but I like to see a dub announcement for it in the future because this is one of those shows that needs a dub.<br />
<br />
Re:Creators is a flawed but fun ride of anime<br />
Sure it has its problems such as being quite predictable along with pacing issues in the first half as well as having a few annoying characters and bad CG the show has more good things in it than bad. Most of the characters were pretty good and enjoyable to watch despite some of them lacking development.<br />
The visuals were good for the most part. The soundtrack was epic and voice acting was amazing.<br />
<br />
This show may not be for everyone but if you can handle heavy dialogue in anime than I recommend this anime to people.<br />
It may not Ei Aoki best work but least it&#039;s a being improvement over Aldonah Zero.<br />
It may not be the best anime of 2017 but was still a pretty good anime overall despite its issues.

    Decided to drop it after a terrible build up to a fight in episode 6 between these 3 characters that I realised I couldn&#039;t care less about if I tried. That and the long ass build up was too cringey to stomach the entire show after experiencing.<br />
<br />
The characters in general are the main reason for this show being a massive disappointment, which it was as it had some potential as an initial idea. They all seemed to have no real development or anything interesting about them, especially after listening to their long boring and tedious conversations. Each character seemed like they could be the interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247653">
        one that I&#039;d finally care about, but no they never were.<br />
<br />
The story and plot is also very boring and tedious. Nothing really flowed, and the initial idea seems good until you realise what a shit job they have done with those ideas. Characters motivations made no sense and the whole thing seemed to move at the pace of a disabled snail.<br />
<br />
The art and the fight scenes were okay, but nothing special, and as such weren&#039;t anything to write home about or increase my opinion about the show in any way. <br />
<br />
Overall, I just felt the characters and plot were too boring and uninteresting to make me even vaguely wish to keep on watching from this point. Don&#039;t get why this one has high ratings, but I would never recommend it.

    I&#039;ve dropped it <br />
<br />
To summarize it: it is an anime with nice visuals, that is ruined by a very badly written story. It is possible to figure out the rough idea of what is going on in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and slightly adjust information in the second.<br />
<br />
Detailed breakdown below:<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
The story writing is exceptionally poor, and the main issue is that the story writer did not have a good idea about presenting new events. So, when the story needs to introduce you to some sort of idea, characters sit down in a circle and talk for 15 minutes. Sometimes they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255028">
        invent &quot;theories&quot; out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted. Everything between fights is incredibly dull, and characters - all of them - act almost in the same fashion. Once again, we have &quot;spineless male protagonist in glasses&quot;, and even though this is not a harem, this kind of character is incredibly annoying. There&#039;s ONE surprisingly well done character of a magical girl, but she doesn&#039;t get enough screen time.<br />
<br />
Also, dramatic and tragic scenes are handled in surprisingly poor and tasteless fashion. <br />
<br />
In general - huge number of dull scenes, or scenes where somebody explains something for a very long time, plus interactions between characters are incredibly awkward.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10:<br />
The art is actually fairly good and characters have decent design. There some noticeable instances of CG use, and characters could use a bit more detail, but overall it is decent.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10:<br />
Thoroughly mediocre soundtrack, that sometimes gets annoying. The anime features annoying &quot;jester-type&quot; villain and when that one was talking on several occasions I&#039;ve felt disconnect between words and character.  This doesn&#039;t happen often in anime, but happened in this case.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s amazingly well done a character of a naive magical girl in the series, who looks genuine in every scene she arrives, and is incredibly sympathetic. However, everybody else is pretty much a carton cutout, and either act in completely stupid way, or follows some sort of cliched role. Interactions between characters are neither believable nor interesting most of the time. &quot;Protagonist&quot; is unlikeable, and is a classic &quot;shy spineless otaku school boy in glasses&quot; (I hoped this stereotype has died, but guess not).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10:<br />
This is a disappointment. The potential of the main idea was high, but poor execution and bad storywriting ultimately ruined it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10:<br />
<br />
The best idea is to skip it. Aside from one well done character, there&#039;s little reason to watch it. If you&#039;re bored out of your mind, perhaps you you&#039;ll enjoy fights (plenty of those), but the dull character interactions and very long talking sequences are very likely to kill the fun.

    Anime community has been berated for many years now. I&#039;ve seen it, you&#039;ve seen it, everyone&#039;s seen it. I think it&#039;s safe to say that, while certain individuals are to blame as well, the major fault lays in the thing that we&#039;re gathered around. Anime isn&#039;t particularly subtle about its tropes or its origin. Stuff that&#039;s acceptable in Japan is often times seen as weird, unnaturally obscure or even morally wrong in other parts of the world.<br />
What I always believed was the major issue however, was the way anime itself has been presenting its fans over the past couple of years. How many characters that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257680">
        that are anime fans were shown in a clearly positive and acceptable way in the last couple of years? Most of them are hikkikomoris, shut-ins, socially awkward or straight up mad people. While I know that this sort of stuff has mostly been portrayed as an example of what you shouldn&#039;t become, I always noticed the distinct lack of people like us, people who watch anime in their free time, who still have a social life, who go to school and study like normal human beings. Perhaps some that already go to work and watch anime as a way to spend their free time.<br />
How about people that are passionate about creating their own work based on anime? We had Shirobako, but besides that? I don&#039;t think I remember someone who wasn&#039;t a somewhat negative example of a passionate fan. Anime has inspired many to create art and to write. So many in fact that nowadays we see the growth of people from overseas who work in the anime industry. There was always a distinct lack of representation of those types of people as well! Until...<br />
<br />
In summer of 2017, a new original anime from studio TROYCA has started its 22 episode run. It received a fairly mixed feedback with several reasonable arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Fast forward to the 26th of May, same year. Mother&#039;s Basement releases a video by the name &quot;Re:Creators is a Classic Anime in the Making&quot;, and at that point, all hell breaks loose.<br />
People who wholeheartedly believed that Re:Creators is simply a bad anime get louder and louder around the internet, negative reviews start to flood in and in almost every single one of them, a word &quot;classic&quot; can be found, most notably in the context of that Re:Creators is the opposite of that, something that&#039;s forgettable and won&#039;t be remembered upon its finish.<br />
So, what is it really? Was it truly a classic in the making? What are the arguments that both sides voice out in their attempt to defend their opinion? Did the show portray anime fans better than any other show? Is Re:Creators something that will fade out, or stay in my head for a while? Let&#039;s get right into answering those questions, shall we?<br />
<br />
*Spoilers included*<br />
<br />
The show starts off when Souta Mizushino, who&#039;s an artist and an otaku, gets transported into the world of an anime that he&#039;s watching. Few moments later and he, alongside the main character from that anime by the name of Selesia Upitiria, teleport back to the real world. Turns out that she&#039;s not the only one who has appeared. They get into a big brawl with a mysterious, unknown character that they call &quot;Military Uniform Princess&quot;, and later on meet other characters who have been ripped out straight from their story. Two camps end up being born, one that is set on destroying the world of the creators that caused great suffering the worlds of the creations, and one that wants to protect it, for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
The most important thing to know going into Re:Creators is that your expectations will most likely not be met, and I don&#039;t mean it in the &quot;Oh, it&#039;s not that good&quot; sort of way, but instead I want to tell you that this series is not quite what it markets itself to be, or what it looks like in the first episode. While you may expect a Battle Royale type of story, or an action oriented one, you&#039;ll be disappointed with how those things are done.<br />
Re:Creators is a show that transcribes itself through dialogue, and culminates through action. Most of its time is spent on set up, exposition and theme exploration, done using a set of strongly identifiable individuals, that are the anime characters, and their creators. The dialogue itself is written very well, with powerful messages getting delivered, clear rules being set and deeper understanding of the narrative or the characters is provided with each set of discussions. You might not be happy with the way the show does it, but it does it really well. Take a look at few conversations from the show, even the ones that didn&#039;t take place during anything important. Meteora explaining her idea of Altair&#039;s plan in episode 2 makes you immediately understand the threat she poses to not only individuals, but reality itself, it gives Meteora a smart, cool and collected vibe, and on top of that it gives you a clear understanding of how the show outline&#039;s will work out, that being big events containing the most important moments from the narrative standpoint will be followed up by both sides figuring stuff out and creating future plans.<br />
<br />
To establish its characters faster and give the viewer a better understanding of their personalities early on, this show simply relies on the fact that most of it&#039;s characters are stereotypical. They&#039;re really, and I mean REALLY easy to read if you&#039;ve seen the genres they&#039;re a part of, or anything similar to the product they come from. The one exception is of course Altair, who&#039;s a compilation of fanart, thus she&#039;s an unknown and has a mysterious presence to her for a long time. What gives those characters actual personalities in general are, more often than not, their creators, with the exception of Mamika. The passion, care, love and attention to detail you see them put into their characters reflects on the stance of the characters themselves, as they are being ripped straight from their world and their story. All of them are characters that the audience respect and care for deeply, those that are popular and are able to touch people, so it&#039;s safe to say that all of them are established and characterized well enough to adapt to new circumstances. If a character, at the point they are in their plot, is willing to kill their Gods or have some personal vendetta to attend to against the other character that was summoned, they will most likely side with Altair. If a character isn&#039;t established properly as a character that would be able to live outside it&#039;s world, they will have problems adapting and understanding other&#039;s reasoning for defending their beliefs. This right here is probably one of my favorite ideas I&#039;ve seen in anime, and it&#039;s executed extremely well too.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, this show uses it&#039;s strongly defined, stereotypical characters to create a narrative, that being fictional characters judging the real world based on their own worlds. It&#039;s the base of the entire plot, most of the time is spent on understanding it and taking things away from it. Alicetaria not understanding why her world cannot be changed, Mamika&#039;s belief of a perfect world or Magane&#039;s twisted image of using the real world for fun are all views that the world would never experience otherwise, and it&#039;s clear that people that get in contact with them undergo severe changes by doing so, especially Souta, the protagonist of the story. I can&#039;t imagine a guy who would need to meet characters from anime and manga more than this guy.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m saying that because Souta is an artist, inspired by gaming, anime, manga and all the other parts of otaku culture. He&#039;s been undergoing a stagnation as a creator for a long time, ever since Setsuna committed suicide. He believes that by not reaching out to her, he is essentially one of the reasons she ended up dying. Of course it was a combination of the online hate and the lack of support, but nevertheless, as a close friend back in the day, realising he was overtaken by jealousy, he takes the blame upon himself, since he&#039;s most likely the only one that could stop it. Seeing her creation wrecking havoc on the world must&#039;ve been a hell of an experience for an already destroyed Souta, but he can find comfort in all the heroes he&#039;s admired throughout the years. Those characters for him, stand for everything that he couldn&#039;t reach, so confessing his story in front of them, and more importantly finding their approval to go on, is the turning point of his life. He comes back to drawing, and even becomes the key to saving the world because of his work, which he created after that.<br />
<br />
But Souta is only one of many otaku&#039;s that this show presents. In fact, this show&#039;s all about them, but unlike most shows in recent memory, it doesn&#039;t do anything grand with them. They&#039;re all normal people, both students and working adults, living their lives and finding comfort by engaging in the culture as a hobby. Painting them in such a light becomes especially important during the last few episodes, which are all about viewer&#039;s acceptance. All of those people, all of them different and watching anime for different reasons, gather to watch something that they love on a big screen, with numerous other passionate fans, who are also invested in those stories, standing right besides them. The show paints this beautiful picture of a giant crowd cheering their favorites on and wondering how will the event go. something like that can be compared to sport events or concerts, and Re:Creators doesn&#039;t make it seem weird or out of place, it shows passion at its purest, just like it did throughout the entire show, showing creators and an aspiring artist that is Souta grow an understanding of their work and why do they make it. This entire show at times feels like it&#039;s a love letter to us, the fans, the people writing about anime, people inspired by it and everyone else involved in the topic, and I don&#039;t even doubt that it is one. You may call it gratification, but it feels so nice to see that the people who create for us, actually appreciate us, and believe that we appreciate them. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s switch it up for a bit and talk about the negatives though.<br />
First one would be the fact that we never truly learn how does Altair move characters and people throughout worlds. It&#039;s something that bugged me for the entire time. Sure, it&#039;s not necessary, but it&#039;s quite a plot hole and definitely something that could influence one&#039;s experience. The best thing I can come up with is that her omnipotent Holopsicon allowed her to do that, but quite frankly, that would be bullshit. You can&#039;t just say that if a creator wrote into the story: &quot;a character can move between worlds and take others with her&quot; and make that a thing without establishing the fact that the &quot;real world&quot; isn&#039;t actually completely &quot;real&quot;.<br />
Second, the show&#039;s visuals seem to take a small dip in the middle, and the last few especially have quite... mixed results in that field. The usually crispy clean designs become more blocky and begin to look less detailed. I&#039;m sure this is something that will be fixed in the official release, like it always is, but that&#039;s how it was while it was airing.<br />
Thirdly, the show markets itself as an action show, while most of it&#039;s time is spent on dialogues or monologues. While I love how it turned out, the talks took quite some time to get used to initially. Giving a viewer a taste of the great action directing, just to take it away from him as it goes on can be frustrating, and it surely was for me until I really got into the narrative and the characterization.<br />
<br />
Back to the positives, let&#039;s talk about the visuals and the music!<br />
The director working on Re:Creators was Ei Aoki, who&#039;s mostly known for his work on Fate/Zero, the script was written by Rei Hiroe, the creator of Black Lagoon (if you wondered who helped on those awesome points of the show, he&#039;s most likely the one, and Aoki just made it flashier and prettier I&#039;d bet), and the music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who you might know for composing the OST&#039;s of Attack on Titan, Blue Exorcist and Guilty Crown, among many others.<br />
<br />
Ei Aoki is quite an interesting figure, in that he himself stated that he&#039;s inspired by Hollywood, and especially Christopher Nolan. You can definitely see that influence in the ending, which is grandiose and mind-blowing, completely out of the scale of anything that happened before it, but still believable to a degree. They both achieve that without sacrificing much of any other parts of their project. The Hollywood influence can also be seen just in the fight scenes. Nobody&#039;s going to tell me that the last fight with Altair wasn&#039;t influenced at least a tiny bit by superhero movies, those all vs one scenarios, which usually diverge into multiple smaller storylines during a big fight. It&#039;s definitely clear that this is Aoki&#039;s style, and he&#039;s not bad at it. I&#039;m glad that he&#039;s brining both Hollywood-esque ideas into anime, and brining some Nolan into it too. He did a great job at directing the talking scenes, he seems to have had quite a few ideas for them, like Blitz&#039;s talk with Altair after which the viewer realizes that they&#039;ve been hiding inside a church after a zoom out, or any talk with Magane and her movement during her speeches.<br />
<br />
The art as well is of high quality, especially the designs of the characters. They bring out the most recognizable, stereotypical, yet cool and fancy attires for each of them. They all look completely different as well, with different figures, a lot of variations of facial shapes, and different color pallet fitting them all in their own ways (Selesia&#039;s boldness = red, Alicetaria&#039;s knighthood and strive for justice = gold and so on). The mechas&#039; look very interesting and fresh as well, Selesia&#039;s smaller, white robot contrasting with Rui&#039;s Giant Robo and all the idea of how they fight, one with a sword and the other one with this big laser coming from his elbow combined with the sheer mass of the machine itself.<br />
<br />
Even more importantly, Sawano&#039;s back and he&#039;s got drops for days! Nothing gets me quite as excited as a good Sawano soundtrack to be honest, and hearing Re:Creators alongside Attack on Titan&#039;s Second Season in Spring was just the best. In Re:Creators, we hear a good mix of his tamer side, as well as a good few tracks that can get you pumped for what&#039;s coming next. The electronic tracks can be cheesy, but that&#039;s Sawano, and he knows how to use that cheesiness and make it amazing. If you digged any of his other projects, no doubt you&#039;ll enjoy him here, there&#039;s no better praise I can give him, he&#039;s just this consistent at making things real.<br />
<br />
And on that high note, I&#039;m going to sum this up.<br />
Re:Creators is a hell of an anime. Hell of a flawed anime too. It&#039;s definitely quite a task to suspend your disbelief for a lot of its stronger moments, but the explanations, the payoff, the eye candy, the ear candy, it&#039;s all there if you can give it a shot. I can&#039;t say it enough, but it&#039;s definitely worth a try, for some of you it might even be a favorite contender, and in time the show itself might grow into an obscure classic that you might be inclined to watch anyway. It has enough Nolan-ism in it that I think some will consider it as one at least.<br />
I know I had a blast with Re:Creators, quite frankly I simply enjoyed it. It&#039;s a fun show to both watch for me, and a fun one to think about, it tackles things that I&#039;d never thought of and pleases me greatly at the same time. Again, I can&#039;t recommend giving it a shot quite enough, if you think you might like it, please do attempt to watch it, even if it&#039;ll be a risky move. Seriously, do it.<br />
<br />
As always, this is purely my opinion, I highly recommend you to develop your own.

    “We can’t introduce a new character this late into the story, the audience won’t accept an ending like that” ~ Character in Re:Creators two minutes after the show itself does exactly this for their climactic battle scene of the final ‘arc’ of the ‘story.’<br />
<br />
I can’t recall any other time where the series I was watching is actively aware of what’s wrong with itself to a degree that they say not to do the terrible ideas they themselves are doing at the same time, as if this somehow justifies them. (it’s meta commentary on storytelling guys, it’s deep!) <br />
<br />
This Modern Classic example of how not to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257751">
        write an original anime is brought to you by a staff who really should have been able to pull off an interesting, engaging series, yet it utterly fails on so many basic levels it feels like they either didn’t care at all or passed off most of the work to some underpaid interns. <br />
<br />
I don’t know what it is about original animation projects, they have all the freedom to be whatever they want and they almost always come out as cliched, stupid messes of a show that aren’t worth watching. That is, if the show came out in the 2010s. Sure there are good original shows sometimes, but most of them end up being like this, or Comet Lucifer. What’s that, you don’t remember Comet Lucifer? Good. I certainly hope this show will go the way of that trainwreck, but a passionate fanbase has already decided to declare this a modern classic anime, one of their favorites.<br />
<br />
And why wouldn’t it be your favorite anime? It broke new ground! By digging itself deeper and deeper into the ground with every episode’s downward spiral from mediocre beginning to mind numbingly idiotic finale! We start with a decent idea for a show, fictional characters come to life and have to deal with the reality of being characters from a story, interacting with their writers along the way.<br />
<br />
And then they all have a bunch of dumb fight scenes for no reason cause that idea above requires actual writing to pull off. It’s far, far easier to write a dumb fight scene then it is to write a decent dialog scene. Not that Re:Classic didn’t try to write dialog, in fact, there’s so much you might forget it was an action show!<br />
<br />
“Did I just contradict myself there?”, you might ask, but no, I wouldn’t write blatantly conflicting pieces of information so close together, I’m not the writer of Re:Creators. The dialog in Re:Creators tries very hard to be smart, but at the end all it amounts to is glue between more stupid, badly animated fight scenes. Characters will switch sides of the conflict on the drop of a hat, generally with a dialog that looks like this: “The information you had was wrong, you’re the villain here!” “Whoa you’re right, I guess I’m a good guy again it’s not like I just shot somebody in cold blood two minutes ago, forget that!”<br />
<br />
The characters of this show are all so stupid, if any of them actually stopped and questioned their own actions the plot would end in like two episodes. The plot that is a ton of fight scenes that lead up to a LITERAL deus ex machina ending, people like those right? Oh wait, those have been an overused cliché since ancient greece!<br />
<br />
I clapped when I saw the zero foreshadowing devinatart OC show up and wins the fight for the heroes cause the writer’s wrote themselves into a corner! It broke new ground!<br />
<br />
Why is this show even remotely popular?<br />
<br />
In what universe does a character go from NOW I’VE LOST IT, I KNOW I CAN KILL to “We’re best friends forever now” because of a single conversation, they didn’t even go through a redemption arc, they’re just heroes now. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest complaints about Sword Art Online is that it’s filled with Cafe Scenes, where characters explain the plot to each other in boring dry dialog. Well, innovator it is, Re:Creators deftly deconstructs this tired trope by having not only cafe scenes, but family restaurant scenes, sushi bar scenes, fast food restaurant scenes, you name it and they’ve probably eaten it while explaining the paper thin plot to Sota, the audience self insert character who adds nothing but gets to hang around the cool kids anyways.<br />
<br />
Sota is a dumb nerd who watches anime and reads light novels and wears glasses, just like YOU, the viewer, can’t you relate to his struggles?? As he stands in the background and occasionally asks questions. <br />
<br />
Is this even a review, is there any structure to what’s happening here? And this is where I blow your minds when I reveal that this lack of structure is actually a clever deconstruction of poorly constructed reviews! Marvel at how I stick it to genre conventions by doing exactly what you’d expect but then saying I did it, how original! <br />
<br />
I can understand the appeal of Recreators on a basic level, the premise is interesting and could have lead to a great show. However, the strength of the concept is meaningless without the execution, something recreators itself seems aware of despite delivering an incredibly trite, poorly made series that coasts due to it’s premise and character designs, which are just similar enough to real characters that people can project their like of that character onto them so you don’t have to write or design a real character, it’s brilliant!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the show has bad production values outside of writing too.  The animation is cheap at best and atrocious at worst. The music is Sawano’s weakest so far. Now Sawano gets a lot of hate, but I’m not one of them really, I’ve liked several osts of his, including some in series I don’t particularly like or enjoy, like Aldnoah Zero. But this show literally has three songs in it’s ost, it’s so weak and it really undermines the scenes when the only vocal insert track plays Every. Single. Episode.<br />
<br />
I have nothing more to say about this, I rambled on enough, the end.<br />
<br />
Don’t watch it.<br />
<br />

    Many of us, especially those newer to anime, consider Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to be among the best, most powerful, and most well written anime out there, and this final consideration is given by the fact its genius playwright author turned screenwriter, Kazuki Nakashima, masterfully constructed its world to be one in which the existence of plot holes was almost completely null and void thanks to the cleverness of a single in-universe mechanic. Spiral Power, the ability to do anything and everything with the right amount of classic shounen fighting spirit, could justify any occurrence whatsoever so long as the characters’ motivations were properly preestablished

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257664">
        and consistent. Not only was this mechanic used to orchestrate some of the most spectacular developments in anime history without compromising the internal logical and immersion of the show at hand, but it was used more meaningfully to deeply theme itself with the ultimate display of universal human empowerment and denial of determinism. If the community at large could understand, appreciate, and accept this and install TTGL as the cultural icon it has since become, then I don’t quite understand why no one seemed to do the same for Re:Creators, a show which not only did just about the same thing, but did it in a way which made far more direct sense.<br />
<br />
Re:Creators is something of a messy masterpiece of metatext and social commentary which revolves around Creations, characters born from as many pop cultural mediums as you can think of, being brought to life by their own significance and prominence in the real world, a measure which is decided by how thoroughly and ubiquitously they and their stories have influenced real people in their real lives—which is something I’m sure you and I can both heavily relate to as anime fans. The show does a shockingly realistic job at showing you in intimate detail how the natural propensities of these characters can be dangerous or dissociative when brought into reality under the right circumstances despite being completely understandable in the fictitious worlds they’d been living in up until this point, like a Warrior who resents our society for engaging with her narrative as entertainment when she was actually there experiencing it as a living hell, or a magical girl who isn’t afraid to dish out apocalyptic levels of violence because in her world explosions only leave behind pixie dust, not corpses. Since the show doesn’t bother churning through all the Creations’ backstories and past lives to force their character development down our throats, it gets to use its time delivering on some juicy “show don’t tell” storytelling, letting us bear witness to their conversations and altercations with one another and their respective Creators, their authors, and judge them for ourselves by both their actions and their words. I loved Re:Creators first and foremost for not handling the humanity of its cast with the same ham-fisted dialogue and obnoxious flashbacks I’ve come to expect from anime, but through genuine discussion and interaction. And for this scripting expertise which assumes you’re not so dense as to miss out on the nuance and subtext, we have to thank none other than the legendary manga author you’d never expect director Ei Aoki got on board to write this thing: Rei Hiroe. Yup, this uncharacteristically intelligent, excessively talkative, plot heavy narrative about how our hyperconnected society conditions us to be reclusive and how the pains of our lives can be transmitted through and reflected by art is also filled to the brim with incredible action, as if it didn’t already have enough going for it.<br />
<br />
Before you start worrying this anime juggles too many genres with the amount of ideas it explores with the amount of characters it does so with, I’ll just come out and concede that, indeed, it does, but while there is a small time skip, the plot of Re:Creators is totally linear in retrospect and essentially boils down to a smarter version of any battle royale show of its ilk right up until its finale when it goes all out on the TTGL action I began by discussing. There’s no stupid or barely explained death game plotline underlying the Creations being brought to life, but rather a naturally flowing story in which people subconsciously bring themselves into conflict with one another based on serious and well-thought philosophical disagreements and truly passionate motivations any viewer with even the most modest opinions on society will have no trouble connecting with or investing in. You are always keenly aware of exactly why everyone is angry with whoever they’re angry with and precisely what about said individual or individuals triggered them to fight, because everything always makes logical sense in regard to the plot and motivational sense concerning the characters and how the events which took place lead them to where they’re currently standing (which then makes the rudimentary strategy employed by the characters in conflict seem that much more foreshadowed and smartly written). Whereas most battle royales will prolong confrontations by separating opponents who should’ve had one another in mortal combat, Re:Creators makes itself something of thriller at times—at least in its fast paced and mysterious opening arc—introducing new elements to the already obscure mechanics at play and already obfuscated players on the field to make any twists, turns, and delays feel less like asspulls and lazy writing and more like an exciting addition to an already creatively overflowing story. Perhaps I’m merely lampshading a more damning issue with the series, but only once all the cards are on the table do the limiters pop off and let the production values of this beauty really strut their stuff.<br />
<br />
As shamelessly teased by the conclusions of both of my previous paragraphs, the action in this show is outstanding, and while action is typically something of little value in my eyes when compared to some thoughtful dialogue, resonant characterization, or deep theming, when a show has all those bases covered to at least some extent of significance like this one does, that’s when the indulgence in the spectacle can begin. Given the fact the Creations are literally fiction within fiction, their powers are all original and from entirely different worlds, and I can easily see why this might scare viewers away given the natural assumption all these powers come with their own overblown Hunter x Hunter exposition dump to explain in painful detail their own asinine light novel magic system and how it measures up to those of the other Creations and their own asinine light novel magic system. Luckily, this mind blowingly ambitious monster of an original anime was written by the author of Black Lagoon who takes pride in giving tugboats airtime and arming maids with shotgun-umbrellas, obviously lacking all the inhibition in the world, and thereby being one who feels no need to stress over the details most shounen anime end up feeling even dumber for for even taking seriously in the first place and assume you, the audience, has enough capacity for enjoyment to recognize these are literally fictional characters within a fictional anime, and their powers are from anime within said anime, so of course you don’t know exactly what you&#039;re looking at! And the spectacle which TROYCA effortlessly tosses around is of the production quality which can stand tall next to the best of the best studios, and given the fact they’re backed by Ei Aoki’s expertly epic visual direction and Hiroyuki Sawano’s characteristically legendary soundtrack of raw inspiration and awe, the reality this is all meant to ride on cinematic punch as opposed to analytical realism becomes all the more clear and all the more fun. It just wants you to take a seat in this rollicking roller coaster ride next to Sōta, our “fish out of water” protagonist who stands back gawking at the flair just as you and I do, and enjoy the ride to its fullest, and the fact the line to get on this ride doesn’t start outside the park is honestly baffling to me.<br />
<br />
Now, to explain why others may misguidedly lead you into believing this show is bad, I’ll have to let you in on one MAJOR SPOILER from episode ten, so if you trust my previous writings or simply don’t wish to be spoiled by reading it, please skip to the final paragraph and finish up this review should you so wish.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
In episode ten, you learn the Creators have the power to change the abilities and nature of the Creations via their “audience acceptance.” They had tried to draw new powers into the story in a controlled and private environment to see if they could alter the Creations in real time to give them an upper hand in battle, but it didn’t work, so they abandoned the idea and assumed the Creations could only exist as they were when they were initially summoned from their world into reality. When a character is fatally wounded in episode ten, their Creator desperately Tweets out the new concept they had previously used to now try and alter their Creation by making the concept public. Once the audience sees it and accepts the new vision of the character as canon, she suddenly gains the power, gets up, and wins the fight in a spectacular fashion. People dislike this show because the idea of “audience acceptance” is used more and more like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann’s Spiral Power as the show goes on, and people think this to merely be lazy writing and forced plot holes when in reality it’s some of the most meaningful and weirdly inspirational writing ever. The audience’s passion ends up playing a huge role in their beloved character’s stories and resolutions, and I find it beautiful.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
In the end, Re:Creators was conceptually brilliant, and it’s a real shame people who didn’t understand it or somehow failed to empathize with it insisted on characterizing its public reception with undeserved derision. Whether you’re looking for timely, intelligent, non-presumptuous social commentary, psychological deconstructions seated in character archetypes you thought couldn’t be more boring, emotional character studies within a genuinely passionate and inspired cast, or just some damn gorgeous action with irreplaceably unique ideas animated to phenomenal production values, Re:Creators will be a delight to your senses and sensibilities for all the reasons I’ve done my best to describe, and none of this is even mentioning the fact I’ve managed to do so with detail and isolated specifics without even telling you the literal plot of the show. Re:Creators is actually not the standard battle royale you’re familiar with, and is instead a story about a young aspiring artist whose past unintentional actions come back to haunt him when one of our fiction-within-fiction personalities comes down like Lucifer from Heaven boasting a backstory so compellingly horrible and motivations so complex and sadly justifiable, I would never dare spoil them. And as this incredible villain manipulates information and garners the favor of more and more misguided Creations as they’re summoned into reality, she orchestrates a conflict of monumental proportions pitting Creations against Creations which I certainly won’t be forgetting any time soon. I already admitted it’s messy. I already admitted it juggles far too many ideas to completely keep its balance, so now it’s your turn to admit the rest is refreshing, laudably ambitious, and absolutely fucking awesome.<br />

    Sometimes when different kinds of things get mixed together. A miracle can happen, forming a new thing that is greater than all of the mixed. <br />
<br />
Cliches, negations, inadmissible.  Those kinds of things. They often appear a lot inside anime series and movies. Because they are unavoidable. Nothing is perfect. Anime is simply just a form of representation for those kinds of things. Acting like a mirror that we, anime fans, see everyday and judge it’s imperfectionness despite the fact that we too are as imperfect as, or even more than the anime, the mirror itself.<br />

Story ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
Re:Creators is such a mess. Yet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332831">
        it managed to appeal me up until the point where I shed tears and spent the fewer hours I have left of the day completing the show. The show was very realistic when it comes to handling. There are characters which came from the world of anime, manga and games. But regardless of the many possibilities of cliches that may happen due to that alone. The story handles it well and makes it an acceptable factor which is appealing. <br />
<br />
Political aspects are used to stabilize the story. They made it simple to understand without me needing to get my head around it much. Moreover, it&#039;s also not over explained up until the point where the show becomes engulfed by politics. <br />
<br />
The story development of this show is solid and progressive. It keeps me intrigued and constrains me within its story. Forcing me to continue until the end. There are only one or two flaws for story development, and that is the overuse of cliches that it nearly become unacceptable. Nearly. Another flaw of the story is the  <br />
<br />
“A good story does not have to necessarily be the one that is accepted by the majority. But it can always be the one that is approved by your heart.” <br />
<br />
When I began Re:Creators I knew right away that I was up to something that I’d never forget. The story is straight out 10/10 so as because it’s exactly what I needed. A unique isekai with the story that could teach us many life lessons. <br />
<br />
Art ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
Troyca’s not really recognized that much. The only anime I’ve seen from them are Sakurako-san and Yagate kimi ni Naru ( excluding Re:Creators ). <br />
<br />
Their art style and quality are high-tier. They never once made me doubt their animation at all. It’s good, and I like it. Re:Creators probably have the best animation and quality amongst the other two anime I’ve seen from Troyca. I’ve noticed this after seeing a couple of fights within the show. It’s high quality and flashy with no low budget drops that makes me feel disgusted for a second or more. The animation and quality is maintained really well for Re:Creators and that contributes to my overall enjoyment for the show. <br />
<br />
Sound ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
The workforce behind the shadows that allowed the show to maximize its potential. The sounds of the show. <br />
<br />
Although the openings and endings may seem mediocre at first glance. As feelings become attached to it, they will turn from a mere time waster to an inconceivable art. Just like how any food can taste better when seasoned. The openings and endings became a factor that strengthened the show and enhanced my overall satisfaction towards Re:Creators. <br />
<br />
The OSTs also have the same role. They’re ACTUALLY beautiful and it made everything so much better. They’re so onpoint with the scenes and catchy that I just can’t use any other words to describe it except the word “masterpiece”. <br />
<br />
Voice acting is also outstanding. The voice actors have done well to voice with the sound and tone that exactly matches the characters they’re voice acting as. They also do well with expressing the emotions of the characters according to what they’re expressing at the moment. And that makes the show even better! <br />
<br />
Character ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
If this anime was interpreted as a system with subsystems. Then the characters of this show would be the system. It connects everything together and makes everything work despite the fact that the “everything” is quite a mess. How do they manage to do this exactly? <br />
<br />
The first thing to understand is to acknowledge that this show is about “anime, games &amp; manga becoming reality”. <br />
<br />
With that set as a mindset. Enjoying the show wouldn’t be as hard as trying to masturbate in less than 5 minutes. The characters come well in both designs &amp; traits. With of course the matching voice and personality which suits their character design. The show makes use of the characters realistically and efficiently. Even supporting characters are given a sufficient amount of role and recognition. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this show is categorized as fantasy. Yet the show tries to make it seem as realistic as possible but still doesn’t make it go over the top in order to maintain that appeal of the “cliches that work”. The characters do a big role in this because there is only one main character who isn’t from another world. They are the reasons why most of the things which have happened in the show are acceptable. They work with the story like they are one with it. <br />
<br />
However… One of the most confusing yet acceptable things about this show is the character developments. It’s so full of plots that it’s making my mind go crazy. Sadly, it is also one of the things that pulled this show down a little. <br />
1 ) They overuse plot armors and plots that it nearly felt not right. Nearly. I nearly doubted the show just because of it. ( probably already mentioned in story ) <br />
2 ) Because they overused them. It makes the ending satisfactory and not a masterpiece. It’s the same feeling as when your friend’s going to leave but then decided to stay with you for 10 minutes longer. <br />
<br />
Overall not bad though. The rest of the show makes up for the satisfactory ending that could’ve been way better. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this show. I could even say that it’s the best isekai I’ve ever seen in my life. Though it is categorized as mecha, my worst nightmare. The show’s barely about mechas so it doesn’t even matter. <br />
<br />
This show teases and makes you WANT the cliches to happen. It’s very hard to accept cliches, but this show knows how to make it appealing before my very eyes. Incredible. Just absolutely incredible. I think I’m running out of what to say now. <br />
<br />
Overall ( 10/10 ) <br />
<br />
Absolute madlad. This anime was a gift from the gods. I’m glad I watched this. This will be something that I will never forget. <br />
<br />
Recommended to everybody honestly. <br />
<br />

    Now-a-days many good anime become mediocre or plain out boring due to the repetition of the almost identical storyline/plotline and the audience (us) being exposed to these clichés or developments numerous times. Thus, whenever a new anime with a different plot arrives, it peaks my interest. Re-Creators belongs to that category and the criminally low score and constant online bashing of this anime spurred me to write my first review on MAL.<br />
<br />
It sets itself apart due to its somewhat opposing setting to the ‘Isekai’ (other world) genre, where typically the MC gets transported to the imaginary world and becomes the hero. In this case, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249765">
        characters, both villains and protagonists, from different works such as Shounen anime, Magical Girl anime, Mecha anime, Visual Novel and Games are transported in the real world. The realization of them being characters dawns upon them and the sense of being ‘entertainment’ pours out a variety of emotions ranging from bewilderment, anger and excitement from being in a new fun play area. Thus, in order to be as much spoiler free as possible, the ideologies of these characters clash and along with it they fight for what they feel will lead to their goal. The most important pull factor for me became the premise of characters with different fighting styles from various genres battling against each other and the unpredictability of these clashes. Music is the strong point of this series, especially the battle music they play in almost every fight scene. It really makes the fights a hundred times more exciting.<br />
<br />
Now, the dissatisfaction usually boils down to the first episode being awesome and the succeeding episodes being void of any action. The simple answer to that is that these episodes are used in explaining the premise of this series, which may arguably contribute to boring episodes in contrast to the first episode. Some (including me) point to the unlikeable MC, Souta, but miss the general point that this anime makes him take the back seat and the rest of the cast makes it much more enjoyable and entertaining. My view on this is to stick with it for a few episodes as it would ultimately lead to better understanding of the setting, plot, battles and in the end more fun to watch. I believe that Re-Creators is a hidden gem and a wonder in the making, causing it to be a must watch.<br />

It was a mistake to have any hope for this series. Even after the impressive first episode, the director and the studio attached to this project was enough to raise some eyebrows. it&#039;s almost a curse of sorts, after Aldnoah Zero wasted the talents of the Fate/Zero director and writer (for the first few episodes anyway), Re:creators seems to follow the same formula. Only this time it&#039;s the writer for Black Lagoon. Surely by now Troyca would have learnt their lesson? Wouldn&#039;t they? <br />
<br />
Join me, dear reader, as we examine what went wrong with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257875">
        the series. No spoilers. The anime is so forgettable I&#039;m having a hard time recalling what happened the previous episode.<br />
<br />
Re:Creators is a reverse Isekai, i.e. instead of the MC travelling to an alternate universe, characters from various manga/anime/LNs travel to the real world. This makes for a very interesting premise, as the first episode shows that not all is fine and dandy when anime characters enter reality. Government interventions and general panic spreads throughout Tokyo as everyone, the audience included tries to figure out the cause behind this mysterious phenomenon.<br />
<br />
Except...well, that doesn&#039;t happen. The anime&#039;s pacing grinds to a staggering halt once you reach the 2nd episode, wherein it just becomes no different than a university lecture. Even watching the anime at 2x the speed doesn&#039;t remedy much, although it did make things more interesting. As more and more creations start entering the real world, you&#039;d expect the real world to retaliate by going mad or something of that manner. A climax is reached as our heroes don&#039;t seem as powerful as they think they are...<br />
<br />
And then the anime just stopped. Really. Break after break and filler episodes with no bearing on the plot and no development for any of the main characters. And then it hits you with a recap episode. An admittedly amusing recap episode. But you can tell that they wrote themselves into a corner after a while, with no idea on how to end the story satisfactorily. <br />
<br />
Then the anime suddenly ends. Before you know it, the plot just accelerates and you&#039;re at the final episode already! Great job everyone! Time to go home. <br />
<br />
You&#039;re left wondering why is it Sawano&#039;s catchy music gets attached to trainwrecks like these. <br />
<br />
You&#039;re left wondering why they bothered commissioning the beautiful character designs to talented fanartists and why bother making a faux-Pixiv to display their talents.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re left wondering why the voice talents of these amazing characters in this Battle Royale Crossover anime of your dreams gets wasted on a project like this.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re left wondering if Nintendo made a Super Smash Bros. anime, would they hire these jokers.<br />
<br />
And finally, you&#039;re left wondering why you bothered wasting 440 minutes of your life watching this dumpster fire when you could be doing something more productive with your life like helping a soup kitchen.<br />
<br />
<br />
2/10<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t bother.<br />

    I’m certain that at some point, you’ve envisioned getting transported into one of your favorite works of fiction so that you could interact with and fight alongside your favorite characters. However, in all honestly, we would most likely fail spectacularly in many of these vivid yet grueling worlds due to our lack of special abilities and general mediocrity when compared to fictional characters. But now I want you to picture the better and more convenient alternative; the characters that you’ve dreamed of meeting get teleported to OUR world. This sums up the general premise of Re:Creators, thus instigating a tale of the interactions between creators

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257670">
        and their creations.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic overview of the anime. Re:Creators is a classic “save the world from destruction” kind of show in that it has a completely overpowered antagonist who wants to annihilate society. Our villain, The Military Uniform Princess (What a mouthful. Let’s just call her Altair, her actual name), carries out her plan by bringing fictional beings from stories into reality to upset the order of the universe, causing it to collapse. At least that’s what heroine Meteora concludes after analyzing the situation. Some join Altair’s side with the desire to force their creators, the ones who wrote their stories, to change them for the better. Others realize that this is just a farce and decide to oppose Altair. Both sides conjure up plans to defeat the other and have many battles, culminating in a final epic confrontation involving all of the creations watched by an audience of thousands. <br />
<br />
While this seems interesting enough, I was relatively indifferent towards the first half of the anime. Now don’t get me wrong, I believe that many aspects of the show were executed adequately. The plot is unique and incredibly layered; the producers made sure to explain every last detail of the story to viewers. The characters are quite diverse and each bring a little something to the table, though many are admittedly overshadowed by the core cast.  However the predominant issue that I found with Re:Creators is its presentation.<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate. A commonality amongst practically all forms of media is something called an information dump. Used in order to enlighten viewers on details surrounding the plot, these info dumps are commonly executed by having one or more of the cast explain story details to other characters. As you can imagine, its somewhat difficult to pull this off without creating a sense of boredom in the viewer since these scenes generally have boring visuals and just seem to drag on. However, Re:Creators fails miserably in that it has one of these in EVERY EPISODE up until the episode 13 recap. I’ve never seen a show have so many info dumps, and what’s more is that they were executed in the most mind-numbing way imaginable. I can’t stress enough how painful it was to watch one character bloviate about the plot as the listening characters just stood there doing NOTHING. They didn’t contribute to the conversation and hardly even moved. I respect the fact that Re:Creators has a lot of depth to its story and needed to be properly explained to the audience, but the way in which this was accomplished was absolutely horrible.<br />
<br />
The recap was more interesting than the previous episodes because of Meteora’s humorous dialogue. It was literally a retelling of all of the information learned previously through the painstakingly boring info dump episodes, yet it was presented in a way that was actually able to grasp my attention, unlike every prior episode of the anime. I guess the producers were so desperate to get their viewers invested in the show that they created a sexy version of Meteora that was solely made for fanservice. How shallow.<br />
<br />
…It totally worked.<br />
<br />
*Ahem* Anyway, I was pleased with the presentation of the second portion of the anime. Conversations became more impactful and were no longer one-sided. That’s right, they actually had two people discussing their ideals and conflicting beliefs instead of having a single character monologuing for half an episode. It was very refreshing. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of characters in Re:Creators, though it won’t seem like it due to the lack of screen time that many of them receive. Prime examples include the magical girl Mamika, the mecha pilot Rui, and the former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. They each received a modicum of screen time and probably could have made for great supporting characters. They really stood out during their few moments in the spotlight, but it wasn’t enough to really flesh out their characters, which is unfortunate. The fiery swordswoman Selesia seemed like the main heroine after episode one, but her importance sort of faded as the anime shifted its attention to other characters. She was cool, but nothing special. The bad boy Yuuya looks and acts pretty awesome, but is barely developed. The antagonist, Altair, is definitely the best designed character. Her powers are inventive and her motivation for being the villain is appropriate. <br />
<br />
Souta Mizushino is supposedly the main character of the story. I’m hesitant to classify him as the protagonist due to his lack of importance. Like Selesia, he faded into the background after episode one. In fact, if you completely removed his presence from half of the episodes, everything would proceed in exactly the same manner. He finally becomes important after revealing his connection to Altair to the rest of the cast. Souta starts off weak, but exhibits many human qualities, which is a point in his favor since he’s just an insecure kid who isn’t at the level of the super powered characters, so his weaknesses are to be expected. He also gains some development and confidence in the latter portion of the anime which somewhat redeemed him in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Meteora receives far more screen time and accomplishes a lot more then Souta, which leads me to classify her as the true protagonist. She’s the one who develops the strategies used to oppose Altair and displays the most common sense and knowledge out of all of the characters. I also found her to be the funniest character (though that’s not saying much) even though she falls under the emotionless girl trope. While her sesquipedalian monologues were incredibly boring, she made up for it in other ways, and overall made for a pretty good lead. <br />
<br />
Magane steadily rose to become my personal favorite character of the show. I simply found her to be the most interesting and entertaining member of the cast, and not just because she’s a chaotic maniac. Magane is also a surprisingly thought provoking character, mainly due to her unique power, which I won’t discuss because of spoilers. I loved the way that she manipulated others characters into saying what she wanted them to. Her intelligence and uncanny knack for twisting the truth made me really start to like her character. Simultaneously, I also held some malicious feelings towards her due to her villainous actions. I find that a character is well written when I can both love and hate them, so I tip my hat to the creators for making Magane the way she is.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who never fails to deliver high quality music. Both of the opening themes, Gravity Wall and Sh0ut, are fantastic compositions that instantly became my favorite anime openings of 2017. The soundtrack is filled with powerful pieces that command the attention of listeners, and the music easily became one of my favorite part of the anime. Many great seiyuu appear as well, including Maaya Sakamoto (Oshino Shinobu, Ciel Phantomhive) as Magane, Aki Toyosaki (Yui Hirasawa, Momo Deviluke) as The Military Uniform Princess, and Inori Minase (Rem) who voiced Meteora. Re:Creators definitely boast a strong selection of voice actors. <br />
<br />
A few of the background visuals tended to be animated with fine precision. Specifically the outdoor scenery, which in some cases would really stand out to me with great color schemes and high detail. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the majority of the character designs. They were rather poor in quality when the characters were both stagnant and in motion. It also didn’t help that many of the scenes took place in dull locations (like office rooms and living rooms) that were filled with completely motionless characters doing nothing but opening and closing their mouths. This is a perfect example of lazy animating, and the lack of effort really shows. <br />
<br />
Re:Creators brought a lot to the table, but wasn’t always able to deliver. While we were presented with an assiduously conceived story, the producers just couldn’t figure out how to effectively provide viewers with plot details. This left the anime feeling hollow and uninteresting, an issue that plagued Re:Creators for a dozen episodes. Many of the show’s characters had the capability to become great, however they weren’t given nearly enough screen time or depth, so they often ended up being simply mediocre. Overall, I sort of liked Re:Creators, but its shortcomings prevented me from truly enjoying the anime. I would recommend watching this if you enjoy the fantasy and reality colliding setting and are able to put up with unnecessarily long information dumps.<br />

    As of chapter 12 i decided to drop the series. This was far from good, instead it was disappointing. Chapter 1 was promising so i kept watching. It kept my hype until episode 6 where it dropped, plain and boring. Episode 7, 8 and 9 where the most boring of them all. Boring fights as well as boring dialogue. They talk about the same topic over 20 minutes, yet the story doesn&#039;t go on. We get to see some action scenes in all episodes, yet they don&#039;t finish them in the next one, they cut it with interruptions of some sort. I get that not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254960">
        everything should be action, indeed a good conversation is needed, but in this case, there&#039;s no progress, they are always at the same point.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s barely to no character development, everyone is just dull, empty and boring (Asides that they are useless), i&#039;d say that the creators have more development than everyone else. Nothing to say about the protagonist, he was boring and weak, but we can&#039;t expect anything from him. And to this point they just dragged the story for 12 episodes, because his smart-ass aka small pride was hiding something about the &quot;main antagonist&quot; which was pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
The anime could&#039;ve been a great one for the season, yet they ruined it. The art and sounds are nice but that&#039;s it. I do enjoy conversation in anime, if they are part of the plot. In this case, the plot was everything, but the things they talked. Dropped with no chance to re-watch. Boring and plain. I have no idea what the studio was thinking, it was such a good premise, but ended up being your typical shounen anime. I don&#039;t really understand where did all the i hype i had come from.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really care if you don&#039;t agree with this, but please refrain from calling me a troll, just because i didn&#039;t like something you loved.<br />
<br />
Story:2 (Dreadful)<br />
Art:6 (Fair)<br />
Sound:6 (Fair)<br />
Character:1 (Pathetic)<br />
Enjoyment:2 (Dreadful)<br />
Overall:3 (Poor)<br />

    Re:Creators is being criminally underrated this season because it had a cliche sounding premise and very meh first episodes. But if Re:Zero and Madoka have taught us anything it&#039;s that cliche sounding premises may not be so cliche after all, and that sometimes shows need time to get the ball rolling especially for a two cour. This show is ballooning with potential, I&#039;m just hoping that balloon doesn&#039;t pop<br />
<br />
Re:Creators is truly a gift that keeps on giving, as it really does have 9s across the board so far for me and is set to keep up that pace. The first thing I have to praise

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249740">
        is actually the supposedly cliche premise. The idea of bring other characters into our world from different universes isn&#039;t exactly the newest thing ever, but it has never been executed in this way. These characters from fiction are actually aware of the oddity of their existence in the modern world, and the other characters are too. We see magical girls surprised by how much destruction and pain their attacks can cause, single minded driven characters that appear foolish when placed in circumstances with real consequence, and very typical anime stereotypes explored as if they were real people. And the best part is, they grow out of those stereotypes as they learn the realities of the world of their creators.<br />
<br />
The interactions between the creators and created are also great. To some creations their creators are like gods, but to others they&#039;re more like parents. I&#039;m pleasantly surprised to see interactions that aren&#039;t entirely unrealistic from pretty much every character in the show. The real live humans behave rationally for the most part, and the anime characters behave like anime characters. As the show goes on, even the more boring characters(like the MC) are fleshed out much more until they become legitimately interesting.<br />
<br />
The great thing about original anime is that their stories are usually better since they don&#039;t have to hack something together to try to give the illusion of finishing a story when the source material is unfinished or sometimes not possible to adapt fully. Re:Creators seems to have a grander plot occurring in the background and I couldn&#039;t be more excited to see where it goes. At this point I could see this becoming a classic as iconic as the first two I mentioned in my review.
