    *DISCLAIMER: A very unorganized and SOMEWHAT SPOILERY &quot;review&quot; of Sunshine s2 which might ruin your viewing experience, so I&#039;ll just say &quot;you&#039;re welcome&quot; in advance for saving your time.<br />
<br />
The Love Live franchise has a knack for being the defier of expectations. Those who go into the series expecting nothing but cancer usually end up taking something positive from the experience. Those who go in expecting happy rainbows and sunshine only get slapped in the face with the cold reality that is School Idol Hell. Love Live Sunshine s2 is no exception to this rule, for what was set up to be potentially the greatest installment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266867">
        in the Love Live anime series ended up being one of the greatest disappointments I&#039;ve yet to come across. <br />
<br />
If Love Live Sunshine had one major step up from its predecessor, it would be how it utilizes subtlety. Very rarely does the show tell you how the characters have developed, and if it does, it gives a great presentation to back it up. Love Live Sunshine actually uses the performances of the girls as ways to show you how much the characters have improved: how the choreography slowly improves from performance to performance, how the amount of band aids Chika has increases from scene to scene. There was no need to state the obvious, or to show Chika getting injured: all of that was inferred through some great shots of Chika just trying her best.<br />
<br />
Did I just give Love Live subtlety points? SORRY GOTTA TAKE THOSE RIGHT BACK because at the same time, Love Live falls back into its old habit of friendship speeches, slow motion eureka jumping moments, repeating the same cheesy lines over and over again, and other tactics to not so subtly remind you that this is a show about friendship! <br />
<br />
Love live teaches you that you can&#039;t solve your problems by shouting into the distance or giving your computer screen your patented GLARE OF DETERMINATION! Instead, shit goes south. Chika goes through a massive identity crisis, hinted through her subtle mannerisms and facial expressions. How is it fixed?<br />
<br />
By having the entire school yell at her! Through sentimental speeches thrown from floor to rooftop!<br />
<br />
Do you see the problem? Love Live always sets up these plot points with so much potential: the subtle build up, psychological conflict, and with minimal exposition and drag. Only for it all to be resolved with the usual cheesy sentimental monologues or speeches that make you cringe. There are so many opportunities for these resolutions to occur through the same methods as the build up, but noooooo let&#039;s have people yelling their solutions while jumping in slow motion, or have the entire fucking school somehow spit out the entire solution to the problem! These cheap resolutions are buzzkills and lazy lazy lazy ways of resolving drama. <br />
<br />
Oh course, I won&#039;t pretend that Love Live Sunshine s2 is the only installment in this series that has this problem: season 1 had plenty of it, and the OG series too. However, what the OG series did was leave room for potential and improvement, and it actually took the opportunity to improve on a lot of the flaws that it had. This was why season 2 of the original was a drastic improvement, and I can even full heartedly call it good. Love Live Sunshine set up the same opportunity for its sequel to do the same, if not even more. With the way it builds up, it seemed promising at first, but it just devolves back into the same exact thing that made people so critical of the series in the first place. <br />
<br />
Changes in directorial styles are nice, but there needs to be some consistency. Love Live Sunshine was commonly criticized for being too similar to its predecessor, and while I agree to some extent, my greatest praise for Sunshine was always how Sunshine felt like a sequel to School Idol Project as much as School Idol Project felt like a prequel to Sunshine. To me, there is no one over the other, there is no battle between Aqours and Muse. They exist together under the Love Live banner, as they should. This was due to how the recycled plot points are used as ways to develop Aqours differently than Muse, and how even though both anime series tackle the same themes, each series usually prioritizes one over the other, or they tackle the theme a different way. For example, Sunshine has more emphasis on the girls actually trying to improve as idols, and this is actually expressed fairly well through the slow improvement of choreography presented in the concert scenes. This contrasts School Idol Project&#039;s emphasis on the girls bracing for when they have to disband, something that Sunshine still touches on but not as heavily as School Idol Project. While School Idol Project dedicated more episodes to the fate of Muse, Sunshine spent less time on that theme but featured more dynamic and hardcore methods of exploring that theme, featuring a FUCKING FLYING VAN, lots of cheesy group cheering and crying. Whilst School Idol Project took the more subtle approach on the passage of time by showing the girls doing slice of life shenanigans through timed events, Sunshine brought out the big guns immediately by making the girls taste failure and fly vehicles into the moon. Unfortunately, Sunshine s2 did this pretty poorly as flying vans and having the entire school chant Aqours over and over again isn&#039;t a very effective way to convey this message. When the hard hitting, tear inducing, heart pounding, and hope brimmed scenes actually make you laugh your ass off, you know that something is wrong.<br />
<br />
The characters of Love Live are the defining factor and also hold the most potential for growth and change. And yet, some things never change. Yoshiko&#039;s comedic antics now are about as funny as they were back then (in other words, not at all.) Yoshiko also still had pitiful development. As you can probably tell, one of my biggest hopes for this season was for Yoshiko to finally get some satisfying development. Needless to say, I ain&#039;t satisfied. But some things do change, and they are pretty nice. Dia&#039;s arc about wanting to be called &quot;Dia-chan&quot; was light hearted and fun, no unneeded sappiness, just satisfying fluff. Hanamaru turned her sass level all the way up, she ain&#039;t holding back anymore. Ruby had an entire arc dedicated to her growing independence in a way that also contributed to the whole &quot;Aqours probs gonna disband&quot; plot point. Did this save her from being worst girl? Nah, but it was still a nice touch. Meanwhile, Kanan actually had some screen time this time around. Riko too gained a decent amount of screen time and her personality was more fleshed out. Chika changed from a happy go lucky &quot;I can do anything&quot; character to one with genuine psychological conflicts, similar to the change granted to Honoka.<br />
<br />
But in order to grant these characters some quality of life buffs, some other characters gotta be gutted into the ground. Take Watanabe You for example. Formerly an irreplaceable asset and fan favorite of the Love Live Sunshine story line, she was demoted into legitimately the most useless character ever conceived. Even Umi, the sociopathic queen of underdevelopment can&#039;t hold a finger to just how absolutely useless You was during this season. If you took her out of the show, nothing would change. This just proves that Sunrise just has no respect for the best girl. An instant flunk! Love Live Sunshine s2, you get a 1/10 for FAILURE!<br />
<br />
Is what I would say if they didn&#039;t give Sakurauchi Riko, the next best thing, a lot of fluff. The dog episode featuring our homie Sakurauchi Riko is not only the best episode of the season, but one of the best episodes of the entire franchise, rivaling the legendary episode 5 of Love Live School Idol Project s2. But one good episode isn&#039;t going to sway my consensus that is Love Live Sunshine s2 may be the worst season of love live to date, if not at least comparable to the mess that is season 1 of the original. <br />
<br />
So how does Love Live&#039;s sound quality fair for this new installment? Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo is, in my opinion of course, the best OP that Love Live has to offer, not only on a song quality basis but on a directorial basis as well. It perfectly encapsulates the energetic yet melancholic strive to shine that defines Love Live Sunshine. The sparkling light in the beginning that shines down on the members of Aqours also fits the shooting star motif that&#039;s commonly brought up throughout the show. Similarly, the ED is definitely a top tier ED, but that is to be expected from Love Live EDs. The seiyuus are splendid as always: I&#039;m a pretty big fan of the Love Live seiyuu scene, especially the Aqours members. I probably like them more than the series itself. When it comes to OST and insert songs, it&#039;s a pretty hit or miss experience. There is one piece in the soundtrack (you know the one) that is constantly played during the melodramatic scenes. While the piece by itself is pretty nice I guess, combined with the already over the top scenes in slow motion and tears that probably took half of the animation budget, it&#039;s safe to say that the OST played a big role as to why Sunshine is way too sappy. The insert songs hold a similar problem. Whether or not you like them is down to preference, but as I stated before: I liked how Sunshine used the concert scenes to show the improvement of Aqours when it came to choreography. What I didn&#039;t mention is how weirdly weaved in one particular piece of choreography was, that being the Chika cart wheel flip move. A whole episode of build up was dedicated to that one move, yet it was transitioned in so badly during the concert scene, it felt more anticlimactic than anything else, oddly placed with no satisfying transition into and out of the concert scene. Another prime example of decent build up with pitiful pay off. Yes, Chika is finally able to do the move, but her ability to do it was triggered by more friendship speeches and an unsatisfying transition. What does this have to do with the insert song? There was no good timing to insert the transition, and the song they used is somewhat at fault for that too.<br />
<br />
You may be saying: Yuni, why are you subjecting this random idol anime to unnecessarily high standards and potential that you probably just made up on your own? No one told you to expect a masterpiece, and you shouldn&#039;t anally shreck an anime for not being what you expected!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just sad that what could have been done right HAS been done right before in the past, so why not now when the possibilities are greater than ever?<br />
<br />
Love Live is all about change and growth. Love Live Sunshine s2 achieves this change and growth but through the worst ways possible. There&#039;s literally an entire episode of build up where the 9 girls inner monologue how they have changed throughout the series. There&#039;s no implications, no subtlety, just the girls directly stating &quot;oh becoming an idol did this to me.&quot; Similarly, the interactions between the girls evolved only very slightly, not at all, or only evolved heavily after major events and get reset somehow. The slight changes in character interactions where a measure to the development of the characters during the original series, and it&#039;s missing or played badly in Sunshine, which is a darn shame. Only a select few characters had a little bit of spice added to their interactions, like Zuramaru and Riko. Sure, this season may have delivered the growth that everyone wanted, but it was done in the least satisfying way possible, a sure cause for disappointment to me, the only one around who actually had such high hopes for a lowly idol anime called Love Live! Sunshine!!<br />
<br />
Ah yes, and my updated order of Aqours members is:<br />
<br />
*sigh* It&#039;s Pronounced &quot;Yoh&quot; &gt; Rick &gt; Hannah Mahroo &gt; I wanna Dia &gt; Yohane Sebastian Bach &gt; Kanan you not? &gt; Mary &gt; Kan Kan Mikan’t &gt; Gangstarooby

    Love Live has come a long way. It’s difficult to imagine now, but when the first season of School Idol Project started back in 2013, idol anime as we know it today didn’t really exist. Just as µ&#039;s was the guiding light for the world of school idols, the franchise led the way for the genre, and by the time of the School Idol Movie, it really had become a global phenomenon. So when µ&#039;s retired and Aqours stepped forward to take its place, fans were understandably upset and worried that this new iteration would tarnish or override the franchise’s legacy. But it was never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266869">
        the goal for Aqours to replace its predecessor, and instead it told its own story about trying to live up to that legacy, and instead accomplishing far more.<br />
<br />
While the first season of Sunshine adhered closely to the formula set by School Idol Project, the second season focused on the ways that Aqours was different. The new generation was never going to measure up against the audience’s nostalgia for µ&#039;s, and that was reflected in the story. Aqours struggles with challenges that µ&#039;s overcame easily, and there are times when they actually fail. These aren’t just failure by circumstance; they will have tried their best and it still wasn’t enough to succeed. We see these characters when they’re at their lowest points, and when they get back up and try again, it makes their victories all the sweeter. The writing is about as subtle as a brick, but it gets the emotions across.<br />
<br />
Although, those feelings wouldn’t resonate so strongly if we weren’t so deeply invested the cast and their success. Sunshine relies more heavily on personal drama than its predecessor, and it works because their problems aren’t abstract and artificial walls, but genuine fears and worries to which we can relate. And instead of having to overcome these problems on their own, the other members of the group will reach out to provide support, which sells you on the idea that these characters are actually friends who care about each other’s well-being. It’s true that some members of the ensemble get better treatment than others, with one or two being reduced mainly to one-note gags, but overall the cast is so earnest that you can’t help but root for them.<br />
<br />
The growth of the characters is also reflected in the performance scenes, which see the characters becoming gradually more comfortable with complex choreography and each other. For better or worse, CGI has always been a staple of the Love Live franchise, and it’s been getting better with every entry. Early performances looked garish and were plagued by unimaginative camerawork, but both technology and direction have improved vastly, and it’s finally reaching the point that CGI can compete with traditional animation. Performances now come alive with dancing in 3D spaces, and varied shot composition and camera effects make for a real spectacle. It also helps that the songs being performed are really good. Aqours has a diverse discography, ranging from traditional Japanese odori to Broadway show tunes. The soundtrack outside of the performances is excellent as well, effectively matching the tonal shifts over the course of the season. On its technical merits, Sunshine soars. <br />
<br />
If I were to look at the anime alone, Sunshine is far from perfect. There’s a lot of valid criticisms that can and should be made, but since that’s not my focus, I’d recommend checking out Yuni’s review, which addresses a lot of them. But for this, rather than just looking at the show itself, I’m also including my own experience watching it, and I find that my enjoyment greatly outweighs any criticisms. For the past 13 weeks, it hasn’t just been the show that I’ve enjoyed, but also being a part of the community that surrounds it. That’s just my personal experience, so it will differ from person to person, but all I can say is that all of the tweets, fanart, and fanfiction that I saw definitely added to my enjoyment.<br />
<br />
I’m going to miss this generation. It’s not quite over yet – there’s still the movie – but the end is rapidly approaching. I’ve always appreciated that the Love Live franchise ends stories conclusively; the dream of being a school idol is fleeting, but the lessons learned will last forever. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to love the next generation the same way I loved this one, but the future looks bright, and I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings.

    Ok, Let&#039;s talk real now.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t come to watch Love Live Sunshine because I looked for some intense and deep story that involves time traveling or... something like that.<br />
<br />
I came here looking for cute idols singing, dancing, aiming high and getting there.<br />
And I got exactly what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
In Season 2 we didn&#039;t really have a &quot;special&quot; story. It&#039;s pretty similar to School Idol Project, with the school being at risk, 3rd years leaving and such. But, it felt like it fit to give some background story so I liked it in the end. (7/10 for Story)<br />
<br />
The animation and art was outstanding. The CGI

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266866">
        dances were executed super well and I have enjoyed every moment watching it.<br />
Of course there were points where the art dropped off, but it was mostly consistent. (9/10 for Art)<br />
<br />
Sound- Which includes Soundtrack/OP/ED/Insert songs. That was the real strength of Love Live Sunshine. These were amazing songs and I&#039;ve enjoyed every single one of them, I listen to them every day because they were so good.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack, too, fit quite well and was nice. (10/10 for Sound)<br />
<br />
Well, we have 9 characters, which is a pretty nice amount. So it&#039;ll be hard not finding a girl to your liking. They were pretty diverse in their personalities yet so close (as they&#039;re all idols), the development between the cast as Aqours, or as one grade (Ex: Chemistry between 3rd years) and all the &quot;ships&quot; were quite outstanding. I found myself really bonding with the characters, and by the end of the anime there are no girls I hate. (10/10 for Character).<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, this anime got a 10/10 from me. And I RECOMMEND IT. Even if you don&#039;t feel like going through the &quot;comedy to drama&quot; story, just listen and watch to the CGI Dances and songs, as they were too good.

    The following was written after the 1st episode stream:<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
The new season of Love Live! Sunshine is here, and with it a new whole goal.<br />
<br />
First of, the visual part was absolutely beautiful, word´s can´t describe how gorgeous the animation is, there´s no doubt that this is the peak of Love Live! animation, the opening sequence goes through various settings which all are detailed perfectly, accompanied by the new opening theme &quot;Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo&quot;, which set the stage for a memorable season.<br />
<br />
As for the story goes, you can see the development that the characters had in season one, but maintaining that ambitious nature of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266871">
        them that lets them keep moving forward.<br />
<br />
Now there´s a new goal for the group, it isn´t just saving the school or winning Love Live! anymore, now they´re aiming to make an impact around the world, and do whatever it´s necessary to let a miracle happen.<br />
<br />
Also, during the first episode of this season there are a lot of references from the first episode of the first season, but now changing Riko´s and Chika´s role for a moment.<br />
<br />
The ending sequence was the most memorable thing to me, sharing a lot of similarities with the first Love Live! endings sequences, the song isn´t only amazing, but it´s also a nostalgia trip through all the franchise in less than 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
The wait is over and it was worth it, this season will definitively teach us the meaning of hard work and believing in miracles, and the trip to reach to that point will be a total thrillride, let´s enjoy this moment together!<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now after 13 episodes has passed, I can safely say that this was the best written season of all Love Live!, they didn´t abused the drama but at the same time you can feel connected to the characters, their growth and personal goals, as well as the collective goals for Aqours, having their own unique approach, both as a group and individuals.<br />
<br />
As for the insert songs, they can only be described as legendary, they will be remembered for years to come for the ones that got to enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
By the end of the season you can feel how everything from season 1 and this season was connected to give a satisfying conclusion for the ones that payed close attention to the development of each character. <br />
<br />
Personally, I will cherish this season forever.

    This is a sequel for the anime with same title. I reccomend you to watch the first season before this season, because this anime is an in-depth story about all the characters. So if you want an introduction story watch the first anime.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Even though this is a music anime, it give you more than music. It will give you a heartwarming story and how all the character bond with each other. The story is so simple, about a school idol group that want to shine. They want to win. All the problem here is just a simple thing, but the pace is something. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420878">
        anime will take us through the journey of how beautiful a friendship is. I just can&#039;t describe how wonderful it is. Beside from the story, they also got the comedy too. Usually first half of the episode is filled with a little bit of story and full of comedy. And the second half is vice versa.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
The art here is normal for an anime. Not the worst nor the best, just average. Its colorful and bright, which is good because this anime is mostly positive and happy. Also we can feel that they lived in seashore, because the atmosphere is really good. The background also give the same thing, its really beautiful and fit with the story. What i really love from this anime art is the fact that every characters design fit their personality really well. <br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
All the VA here is doing a really great jobs, especially the 9 main characters VA. They are not only doing the VA, but the OP and ED song too. Heck, they even have an idol group in real life which we can see them live singing on stage. They also release a lot of song, you can listen to them in your favourite music platform. Me too sometimes enjoy their song while doing homework or when playing some games. VA talk aside, we also have the great BGM. The BGM is not always there. But when it come, you can clearly hear them and enjoy them. Fit really well with the situation.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
The fact that they can made 9 MC and make their personality different is already a big thumbs up. Like i said above. This anime is an in-depth story about the girls here. The only one that changing here is that they are more mature than before, i guess. They all have their own special episode and i really like it. Because we know more about their personality and all. They solve their problem more seriously as we progress through the anime. We can see all the girls here grew up. While yes they are now more mature and serious, they still have the silly side on them.  Every episode start with a quick summary of the last episode. And the one that narrator it is the MC. Really, just watch the anime and you can see why i give their characters a 10 out of 10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I really really love this series. Its not only give me a show to watch but they also motivate me. I&#039;m also enjoying all of their content from the anime, game, song, even the seiyuu livestream. I wish that someday i can see their live show. This series is so special for me, i&#039;ll definitely rewatch this in near future with dub. If you like the kind of anime that gives you a spirit to continue your life, feel free to watch this. It is helped me a lot during this hard time.<br />
<br />
Thats all i can say about the anime. I really don&#039;t have a word to describe how amazing this anime is. You should really watch it yourself. They also have a game called LLSIFAS, in there you can read more of their stories if the anime doesn&#039;t enough for you to consume. The last thing i wanna say is thank you for reading my review.

    My original review was already really long. And I still stand by all of it. So, I&#039;m just gonna link a pic of that here (https://imgur.com/a/4Bfs5) so that I have more space to talk about a revelation that dawned on me recently. I swear I&#039;m not going to do this often.<br />
<br />
So, I&#039;m now 6 episodes in. And I&#039;ve bumped up my scores for:<br />
Story: From 3 to 6<br />
Art: Remaining at 9<br />
Sound: From 7 to 8<br />
Characters: From 5 to 7<br />
Overall: From 7 to 8<br />
Enjoyment: From 7 to 8<br />
<br />
So, you may wonder be wondering. What could have possibly happened to change all of these scores? Basically, the performances

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263458">
        are even better than I thought they were. So the thought came to me when I saw the main character Chika do this absurdly complex move on stage. The first thought that came to mind was, &quot;Okay, I don&#039;t care how many days she trained, she did not just pull that off flawlessly&quot;<br />
<br />
But then I looked back at the dancing there, and some from previous episodes, and some from last season, and it hit me. The reason why I didn&#039;t like the last season as much as this one was because the dancing was INTENTIONALLY bad. The choreography was INTENTIONALLY boring.<br />
<br />
Seriously, go back and watch Mijuku Dreamer and Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai. Watch how basic the moves are. They aren&#039;t even really working as a team yet, they just need to have enough unity to synchronize actions. And they are often just standing in rows and walking back and forth. Really boring stuff. But that&#039;s the thing, they&#039;re a brand new group. Of course, they can&#039;t pull off cool stuff yet.<br />
<br />
I genuinely think this was all planned because even watching Omoi yo Hitotsu ni Nare from episode 11 of season 1, nearing the end of the season, it&#039;s clear that the choreography is already a huge improvement over where it started. They&#039;re interacting with each other much more. And are playing around with weird positioning and aesthetics.<br />
<br />
But it only gets better as season 2 goes on. Every live is stronger in some aspect to the last and they are growing in a way that we can track. Rather than that asinine ranking system from the original Love Live outright telling us, through a number, how much they&#039;ve improved.<br />
<br />
This gives credibility to the narrative that Chika could actually do what she does in episode 6. And it gives the entire series a new layer of depth and complexity that I never considered up until this point. Character growth is clearly presented through their craft so they feel so much more real. The plot points assist in that growth, so the story (even if it&#039;s still kinda boring) feels more impactful.<br />
<br />
That kind of storytelling through what I thought was already fantastic visuals is what has now made an anime that I reluctantly watched, to now being something I can confidently say is very good.

    This was an overdue review. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Love Love has done so much for so many people, despite what you might think of the franchise. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t something out of a masterpiece. It is bland and simplistic and the characters have one dimensional personalities. Too bland. Too simple. Sometimes a little too simple. <br />
<br />
We were thought to believe that compelling stories have to be meaningful, cathartic. Just like life itself. But we sometimes forget that life does not have to be cathartic. It can be simple. It does not have to be convoluted or complicated in order for it to work. Sometimes it clicks. Just like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299308">
        that. <br />
<br />
Some things do not have to be complicated for them to work out just fine. <br />
<br />
Chika Takami knew that. Her friends knew that.<br />
<br />
She wanted to find something that made her life shine bright.<br />
<br />
That is something very simplistic in the journey of self discovery.<br />
<br />
It does not matter where you come from. What you do. What you believe in and who you find along the way. Sometimes things just click and nobody can take those experiences away from you. This is what the meaning of self discovery truly is. It is purely subjective. If you have learned from them it does not matter what other people think.<br />
<br />
Love Live is just that. It clicks. In its simplicity it clicks and brings you along the way.<br />
<br />
(And it might not, but it&#039;s still your own personal experience)<br />
<br />
I met a twelve year old girl this past summer that got into Love Live thanks to a friend. We are fifteen years apart and we spent a whole afternoon talking about the story and characters.<br />
<br />
I could have never been able to enjoy a conversation with this young girl if it was any other anime. It was an easy going conversation that to this day I cherish deeply, because it made me see something that I had not seen in myself. In order for things to work, I don&#039;t have to think too hard about them.<br />
<br />
It does not matter if the story is not as perfect as you might think. <br />
<br />
It is so important to remember that things don&#039;t always have to be difficult. They can be easy. As adults we constantly say &quot;It&#039;s difficult&quot;. Sure, it is difficult, but it does not always have to be that way. <br />
<br />
Love Live is a beautiful story about accepting the simple things about life, because way too often we don&#039;t. We just forget them somewhere in the back of our brains, until we go insane. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, this is why Love Live is cherished and relatable amongst so many people, because it&#039;s about a simple group of teenagers with simple goals, looking to follow a common dream. Whether if it happens it does not matter. It is still the journey of self discovery.<br />
<br />
It was the same for me. I started Love Live not knowing what it was and hearing so much hate about it. I almost thought I was going to hate it as well, yet I found myself compelled into an unexpected world that made me laugh and cry and that made me realize, things don&#039;t have to drive you mad in order to work. They just do. Go with the flow. If you can&#039;t control it don&#039;t control it.<br />
<br />
I finally got myself to watch the last episode of this anime after a year of putting it off, knowing full-heartedly that there might not be another anime in this franchise. And I was not let down.<br />
<br />
Love Live has made an impact on so many people. For bad or for good it doesn&#039;t really matter.<br />
<br />
I am just so happy that I was there to see it happen.<br />
<br />
(Now please don&#039;t kill me for writing this) -Peace

    I need to write this.<br />
<br />
I feel compelled to write this.<br />
<br />
A single &#039;tags&#039; box can&#039;t possibly contain all of my thoughts and feelings for this season.<br />
<br />
So, before we get right to it, heavy spoilers, if there&#039;s anything worth spoiling anyway.<br />
<br />
Ready? Okay.<br />
<br />
Love Live Sunshine S2 is shit. <br />
<br />
After S1 set the bar for what was, most likely, to be the best season of Love Live ever, maybe even surpassing the masterful S2, ended up being the corniest, most obnoxious, most mind-numbingly boring, most underwhelming experience I&#039;ve ever had with a piece of entertainment. Yup, this thing is down there with Terminator Salvation and Bioshock 2. But, to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267295">
        be fair, it&#039;s not exactly Final Fantasy X-2. How do I say this? It&#039;s a piece of shit but not entirely.<br />
<br />
Unlike the older seasons, it looks prettier. The soundtrack is nice. And the 3D animation is nice to look at, not like the awkward CG models they used in the original. The 2D animation is a lot slicker and more animated, allowing for a range of expressions in body language (which they didn&#039;t do at all). As for the girls themselves, DO YOU SEE THAT DETAIL? The amount of work they put into making the girls a lot prettier and flashier is impressive. As a training animator myself, I can just imagine the sweat and tears put into the lineart per frame. <br />
<br />
Hm, what else... Yup, that&#039;s it for the positives, I think. Now let&#039;s tear this thing apart.<br />
<br />
One of the key things that made Love Live so good was how they utilized drama. Whenever there was a situation the characters couldn&#039;t handle, it was always given due care, embracing an amount of subtlety or loudness that always fit the situation. Yes, even the massive outbreak scene in the original S1. The way they build up scenes with music, voice acting, blocking and camera angles manage to convey the emotions the characters are feeling. The other key thing was silence. The characters would only talk when they needed to, and convey what they needed to. This is true for the original and Sunshine S1. The scene where Chika expressed her disappointment and sadness over getting zero votes was masterful. It is a very good example of saying what you need to say: &quot;I&#039;m disappointed, I&#039;m disappointed&quot;. Just from these lines alone, you could feel all the emotions pouring out from her, and the strength she lacks trying to cope with the situation. This is a scene I remember to this day, and I&#039;ve only seen the whole season once, last year. It&#039;s masterful, and embraces what Love Live stands for - following your dreams and growing to become better.<br />
<br />
See all those great thing I said about Love Live? THIS SEASON HAS NONE OF THAT.<br />
<br />
The way drama is handled here is exactly what I expected of Love Live before I watched the original; corny, loud and meaningless. The school is shutting down, they failed to save the school but they have to get up and do Love Live anyway! How do they convey these set of events? In the laziest way possible. Chika is on the brink of losing hope, the group of schoolgirls can&#039;t convince her out of it. What saves the day? AN EVEN BIGGER GROUP OF SCHOOLGIRLS. Even at the ending, when they&#039;re closing up the school. This is the perfect moment for silence, letting the feeling sink in that &#039;this is the end and we need to move forward&#039;. But NOPE! Gotta keep telling each other and letting the audience know that &quot;we&#039;ll be together foreeeveerrr *heart* *heart*&quot;. The way they resolve every instance of drama is just plain lazy. I don&#039;t know, but they always feels set up, like it&#039;s just there just so something can happen or they say things just to consume empty space when there&#039;s no need to. The biggest thing I want to address is the Saint Snow arc. This could&#039;ve been an amazing arc, rivaling the original S2&#039;s Rin and Nozomi episode. But nope, it was a rushed and inconsequential set of episodes about characters that had 0 to no buildup. Ruby is such a disappointing character. She was at least fun and felt involved around S1, but the way they utilized her for this arc, getting involved with Leah because she also had a sister and she was seemingly concerned, doesn&#039;t work for me AT ALL. As for Leah, her problem just felt plain shallow to me. Not that it wasn&#039;t. Losing the whole competition is something very demoralizing for the two of them. ... So why didn&#039;t they show that it was? This is another problem with the show: not putting in good buildup or drama when there was a dire need for it. This arc was in DIRE need for some good scenes, showing the tension between the two sisters, building up Ruby and Leah&#039;s friendship while developing the two in some way that it shows us who they are. The series tries, but it falls flat on its face because the scenes really just don&#039;t work for me and just feel empty without the proper backing. Ruby building up the confidence to make her own decisions? Great! Where&#039;s the part where you established that?? It really just doesn&#039;t work for me.<br />
<br />
And while we&#039;re at the topic, let&#039;s talk about the characters. S1 built up these characters to have possibly amazing arcs because of how well established they were, and how their unity felt organic and something that could potentially create amazing and fun mini arcs for the group. But here we are with S2, where the main dilemma is the group&#039;s refusal to put -chan at the end of Dia&#039;s name. What happened to all the dynamic characterization in S1? You can&#039;t possibly tell me that all the things that made each character interesting somehow disappeared after S1? Where did You&#039;s confidence issues go? Dia&#039;s love for idols? Kanan&#039;s love for the sea? When did Aquors&#039; determination to follow their dreams, be free to be themselves and shine yet keep asking themselves what it means to shine?? And turned the girls into uninteresting one-note characters that say the same things over and over (&quot;Buu Buu desu wa&quot; is the most ear grating thing I&#039;ve ever heard in my life)? <br />
Well, not entirely.<br />
I missed one positive thing about this season - the dog episode. The way they gave Yoshiko and Riko this fun and unlikely friendship over a dog and make them realize things about themselves and each other.To make things better, both subtlety and silence were present. How Yoshiko expressed how she didn&#039;t really believe in the occult but did it anyway because she felt something special from it and Riko receiving those words from her reminded me why I loved Love Live so much. And it gave me hope that maybe the series would go back to being good again, but nope it became boring the following episode. I honestly don&#039;t even remember what happened. What happened again? And what sucks is that they tossed away this relationship almost entirely after, turning Yoshiko back into a dry joke instead of bringing out her internal dilemma. <br />
<br />
I feel a need to address the songs, because really, none of them were memorable for me. They sounded like the filler songs you&#039;d play in SIF. None of them stuck with me at all. They felt cheesy, boring to listen to and I&#039;d occasionally pause in the middle of them to get a drink.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s relatively easy to get away with the phrase &quot;It&#039;s just an idol anime. What did you expect?&quot;. It&#039;s hard to explain to people that the Love Live is a great series and could be a very meaningful experience. What this season is is precisely what people who haven&#039;t seen the show think the show is - just another cute girl anime. Just another corny, boring slice of life show with some music.<br />
<br />
This show is an utter disappointment. And I seriously hope future installations strive to do better. But, to Sunrise, this season is probably a smash hit so I&#039;ll hope instead that a more competent director or writer comes around. Love Live set the bar high, and I seriously hope someone steps in and meets the quota next time around.

    The second season of Sunshine is truly something. In one way, it&#039;s absurd, because it just isn&#039;t real to have students be, for example, so loving and passionate for their school.. all the time. In another way, absolutely fantastic. Sunrise have done it again with a charming second season that I think gave me even more than expected, warmer &amp; lingering feelings for Aqours. This might be my favorite LL entry.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to the plot-line in this season, very similar to the first series. Second Love Live is coming around, there are concerns about the 3rd years&#039; graduation and what Aqours should do after,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301162">
        some more funny sequences and drama, though what Sunshine excels in is portraying the connection between Aqours better, gracing the fans with a rewarding experience and all the more feelings towards Aqours this time around and the whole series and the amount of drama is being kept at bay, not bland &amp; not exaggerated at times at any point.<br />
<br />
The artstyle is much better this time around, even the CGI. It didn&#039;t feel like a distraction and if you&#039;re particularly into idol stuff and cute girls singing and dancing you&#039;ll find this to be pretty fun to see actually.<br />
<br />
The main girls and also Saint Snow have also gotten their well-deserved development and even though there isn&#039;t widely much of it, it&#039;s still a lot better and satisfying compared to what felt like a rush and rocky start in the first season. There&#039;s all the more reason to like &amp; care for the girls.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of Love Live never decreases in quality. The music is awesome to listen to and the better CGI comes off as an enhancement to the experience. I find myself listening to MY Mai☆TONIGHT and Awaken the power often though since those tracks in particular are some that are of more appeal to my taste.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know what to expect from the movie or even the future series, if there ever ends up being one again. Overall, Love Live is an entertaining franchise that&#039;s surely to get you in your feelings which depends on whether you enjoy a show like this or not in the first place. It has been an amazing run and i&#039;m sure the movie&#039;s gonna be too.<br />

Love Live Sunshine&#039;s 2nd Season by the by gives us the conclusion to Aquors journey to the Love Live stage with all the hijinks and heartbreak all under the banner of fixing the mistakes of the original Love Live series and doing it well.<br />
<br />
LA first thought that Sunshine&#039;s spinoff series was nothing but a pale imitation and meta joke to the original series, however by this second season, this season utterly changed what LA thought of Aquors and their goal.<br />
<br />
The second season left off from the first, but this time more character development from the characters that &quot;kinda&quot; needed it. Let&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266919">
        start off with Dia essentially getting way more screentime and meme worthy scenes than ever before making her LA&#039;s second favorite character by the end of it. Riko and Yohane got a joint character development together and though LA liked Riko and Yohane&#039;s friendship and everything, their development was slightly off executed in terms of themes, but nonetheless Yohane continued to be LA&#039;s favorite character even through it all. Now the more interesting character developments came from RUBY of all people as well as their rival Saint Snow&#039;s Ria Kazuno. This is one of the first things LA noticed Sunshine&#039;s second season did better than the original series, that of showing that even rival idols have their own problems of their own in comparison to aRISE who were already famous and popular and knows how to solve everything. Together with Ruby, we get some great double sister sibling character development from Dia, Ruby, Ria and her older sister Seira at the same time. Lastly would be Chika herself and how she develops as both a leader and how she handles everything and trying to be the best to save her school.<br />
<br />
-sigh- and even the second season won&#039;t give You a PROPER CHARACTER FOCUSED EPISODE...<br />
<br />
Sunshine&#039;s 2nd season for LA at least showed that it wasn&#039;t trying to be a pale imitation of the original, this time, it was gonna fix the mistakes of the original.<br />
<br />
From the aforementioned rivals being looked at a different light to the finale and eventual change of goal that Aqours goes through was a welcoming change even if this second season by in large was going at a slightly slower pace but the same flavour and personality it always had in the first season.<br />
<br />
 The animation done once again by Sunrise was typically of great quality, from the shiny character designs and beautiful backgrounds. The concert scenes by in large though it has Love lIve&#039;s typical CGI, like in the first season, it looked polished for the most part in terms of CGI, but the choreography and backgroundings for some of the concerts were GORGEOUS to look at some times. Seriously this might have been Sunrise trying to outdo themselves in the animation department.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, it was pretty much the same from the first season, with some highlights of Ai Furihata getting some limelight as Ruby to Aika Kobayashi doing her chunni thing as Yohane. However for LA, the best voice actor goes to Dia&#039;s voice actor, Arisa Komiya. Nonetheless the same old voice cast, but for LA, they honed in their character even more this season.<br />
<br />
Sunshine&#039;s second season because of how it dealt with Aqours&#039; problem head on with a few hijinks here and there, it was serious for the most part as to what kinds of leaps and bounds, constant trials and tribulations Aqours went through to the point, you can&#039;t help but root for these underdogs and maybe even make them want to win Love Live! after everything they have been through.<br />
<br />
If Love Live Sunshine&#039;s 2nd Season did anything for it&#039;s finale was give a fulfilling conclusion that we all wanted and Sunshine gave it to us in spades. Yes something this second season outdid or something the original series never did give us was &quot;closure&quot;. From giving us what the 9 members of Aqours is gonna do in the future to resolving all plot threads, making us root for these character and maybe Aqours might win and giving us actual closure on what happens to Aqours and the school, something not even the Love Live Movie or the original&#039;s second season never did.<br />
<br />
From pale imitation of the original, to fixing the mistakes and improving of the original series&#039; formula, Sunshine&#039;s Second Season was a great sendoff to the series with no loose plot threads, giving us characters to root for, character development *cough* cept You, seriously no You episode C&#039;MON *cough* that help flesh out the majority of Aqours all under the typical Love Live personality and spunk it had in the original series. <br />
<br />
Aqours really did shine by the end of it all...

    All here is very brand-new Love Live! because i found many of new things from this series of Love Live!. but, it still have a same format with first series Love Live!.<br />
<br />
If the first series tell about &quot;Victory&quot;, this series tell us about &quot;Determination&quot;. Every character in this series have a lot of development and make me curious &quot;what next will happen?!!&quot;. Story looks like not how the member reach their dream but only they activity to spent a time every day before they school shut down. But, thats the point how i love this series. Every character show us they unique personality and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268248">
        they grow up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where theres a meeting theres separation&quot; CMIIW. I think thats the point from the end of this series.

    Man. I like Love Live. I loved the first series along with the first season of the second series. I don&#039;t expect much from this show because it isn&#039;t much, to begin with. It&#039;s the kind of show you turn your mind off to and just have fun with. It&#039;s about a group of kids working to achieve their dream. But this season really knocked it out of the park with being boring and melodramatic. I hate to say that.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The story relies on cute girls doing cute things to achieve their goal of being &quot;radiant.&quot; That isn&#039;t a totally bad thing in itself but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267319">
        this particular season just seemed to lose its way. There wasn&#039;t much of a story. They just repeated the same things over and over until the end of the show. It was like the middle of Your Lie in April. You kept seeing the same clips over and over and hearing the same pieces of dialogue from different characters. It was so incredibly boring.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Aside from each and every character looking exactly the same as each other, the animation is very fluid and nice looking. It is very obvious that Love Live! Sunshine!! takes more time to focus on the movement of their characters and quality of the animation and I will give them props for that.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
A big part of Love Live! Sunshine!! should have been the music but it took a backseat to the melodrama. I skipped the opening every single time because it just wasn&#039;t pleasing to the ear.  The songs in the first season each had a personality and theme to it. Each and every song in this season seemed to be a copy and paste of the ones before it. They all sounded the same and that was very disappointing.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
In the first season, I thought that the characters from Aqours might have the potential to be even better than the ones from the original but that was shattered. They try very hard to delve into the depths of each character and explore their emotions and feelings but it falls flat. Their motivations and the way that they speak all seem fake. Each conversation has forced metaphors, repetition, and some kind of mushy phrase that is somehow supposed to get you to like the characters more. In reality, it only made more indifferent and bored with them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
The whole thing wasn&#039;t terrible but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as I did the previous seasons. At one point in the show, there is a scene where their van flies up into the sky with their rainbows flying out of the back. I think it was at that point that I realized that they ran out of ways to show that the characters were feeling something. I cannot stress how repetitive it is with all of the crying and drama. Even I have become repetitive telling you how repetitive it is.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
The cheesiness and corniness of this season have confirmed that there is no need for anymore Love Live! The &quot;story&quot; has been told. If another season is made with new characters I will not be surprised. It&#039;s a good way to support your best girl by buying &quot;Love Live pliers.&quot; (Yes that is a real thing.) Just save yourself some boredom and cringe and watch something else. You are not missing much.

    &lt;SHORT REVIEW&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
1. Beautiful music<br />
2. CG way better than 1st season<br />
3. Individual character developments<br />
4. Went to a separate route different from the original series<br />
5. A collaboration with another idol group<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1. First 3 episodes were a sore to get through, so many meme materials.<br />
<br />
&lt;LONG REVIEW&gt;<br />
<br />
I hated the second season at first. There were just too many meme materials. It&#039;s seriously annoying to watch. I struggled through the first 3 episodes and after the first song came out, this series became more and more better, until the point that I rated it an 8/10.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t know, I started watching more anime because of Love Live. I love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266094">
        J-Pop music before that and Love Live fulfilled all my desires by mixing music and tournament together. It&#039;s sad to see that series end. After a year, I heard that Love Live was getting a sequel featuring different characters. I was overjoyed by that. Then, I started following Aqours. I love the first season, although there are a lot of points taken from the original series, nevertheless I still enjoyed watching it. Now I will review these 2 seasons together.<br />
<br />
A lot of complaints I saw with this series is that it copies the original series very much making a lot of Love Live fans hating this sequel. But this season manages to fix a lot of them. It went down its original path, parting ways with μ&#039;s and I like that. The path they took was also very interesting. I won&#039;t spoil you but the development the plot decided to take really did shock me. It&#039;s way more different than the original Love Live series.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Love Live, of course we are going to talk about the music. It&#039;s outstanding. Now I won&#039;t compare this to those of μ&#039;s because they are 2 complete different groups with different singing styles. The songs in this series really stood out to me. I enjoyed listening to each and every track. The dance sequences were also properly choreographed and the CG was much better compared to previous seasons. Personally my favorite song this season were &quot;My Mai Tonight&quot; and &quot;Awaken the Power&quot;, especially &quot;Awaken the Power&quot; where I got to see a collaboration with other group, made me like this season even more. <br />
<br />
The characters that Sunrise decided to focus a lot of time on this season, were annoying at first, but slowly after each of their own arcs I started to care more about the and to like them more.  It&#039;s a surprise to me too because I never thought I would like the characters of Sunshine!! this much. A lot of characters got development throughout this season and that&#039;s what made me appreciate this season a lot more. <br />
<br />
The art and animation was pretty consistent. Nothing to praise and nothing to complain about. <br />
<br />
Overall, I love &quot;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season&quot; a lot. It disappointed me at first but managed to grab my attention back. Great job! 8/10 That&#039;s it for my review. Thanks for reading.

    Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews back in action! Today&#039;s pertinent information includes the fact I&#039;m working the dubbed version, and that I&#039;m going on the premise that you are familiar with season one of Love Live! Sunshine!! I mean, if you&#039;re not, why start in the middle of the second season right? The short of it is that I found that this season the Aqours girls find their legs and really pull off a great tale. There is tension and drama and not everything goes the way one would expect, so I wholeheartedly recommend watching if you liked Sunshine!! season 1 or even if you were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315404">
        a little iffy on it. This season makes the girls shine. Let&#039;s break it down like a backup dancer on stage. <br />
<br />
Of note, there will be some spoilers in this review, especially relating to the content of the previous season. I will try to keep it at a minimum but some things have to be covered to make sense. <br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
In the opening we find out that not only did the girls NOT win Love Live! but they didn&#039;t even make the regional qualifiers. Not only that, but they were only able to drum up about 10 prospective students. This point is kind of a victory for them, as they wanted to change the zero into a one, and they did so, but it was nowhere near enough to save the school from the impending closing. So the small goal was met, though it didn&#039;t affect the overall dire situation, and of course the girls didn&#039;t just blast through Love Live! like it was nothing. There&#039;s a strong hint of grounding for most of this season. This is much less about winning the moon and stars, and much more about doing their personal best (rebwestey as Ruby might say). <br />
<br />
So the issues they are facing are the same as season 1, firstly that they need to get more prospective students, and secondly that they want to achieve their dream of playing at, and winning, the Love Live! competition. Toss in the mix the antagonists from the previous season and the sudden twist their relationship with Aqours takes, and there&#039;s some compelling viewing. I felt like we really got to know the girls better this time around as their personalities shined through. Dia is still bitchy, but a softness is brought out in her. Mari is still overly optimistic but finds herself forced to face reality and come down out of the clouds. Each of the girls seemed to have moments like this. <br />
<br />
I know in the season 1 review I declared my love for the girls of Muse, but this second season of Sunshine!! really ranks up there with the original set. In fact I think the cast is better presented and explored than in the Muse seasons. I don&#039;t remember knowing much about the shy girl in Muse, but I do feel like I know Ruby or You, or even Hanamaru whereas in Muse there was shy girl, cat girl, so forth. The interaction and chemistry in the show seems to be at a peak in this season. For this reason alone, I feel the show is worth viewing. <br />
<br />
The original questions remain: will Aqours save their school? Will they win the Love Live! competition? Some of the answers might just surprise you. I was somewhat shocked to learn that not everything turns up roses for these girls, but that&#039;s okay, because by going against the expectations of the genre and its ubiquitous &#039;happy endings&#039; they really caught my attention, and I was in a position of not being sure on what would and what wouldn&#039;t happen. This gives the show an edge to it, one that heightens the drama somewhat. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The girls still look good. I really adore the artwork on all of the Love Live! series. The distractions from last season about comparing Aqours to Muse have been obliterated as the girls&#039; personalities helps keep everyone&#039;s appearances from being cookie cutters of Muse&#039;s girls, as I first had trouble with last season. The detail is superb, the girls are recognizable whether their in their school uniforms, workout clothes, or idol costumes. The idol costumes themselves are interesting and varied, and not overly busy. The art is very cutesy and colorful, befitting the tone and theme of the series. Love it! <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The opening and closing themes are as &#039;pop music&#039; as they come, but they work and are a lot of fun. I didn&#039;t like the themes as well as I did Muse&#039;s, but they stand strong on their own. The voice acting is varied and interesting, ranging from a high pitched younger girl to a deep, mature sounding senior. The &#039;leader&#039; of the group has a bright and bubbly voice, and the oddball comedic relief retains her dramatic flair. All the things I wrote in the review of season 1 of Sunshine!! apply. No changes in voice actors that I heard, and they all performed very well. I do believe Mari uses more Italian in this season than the last but the story explains that by pointing out she is moving to Italy for college after graduation. Helps to practice the language I guess. <br />
<br />
If I had to give a few complaints, it would be Ruby the high pitched first year&#039;s voice, as it strayed near annoying at times, and her occasional flinging around of the term &#039;rubwestey&#039; or whatever. She doesn&#039;t do this often, so it&#039;s not a huge thing. The other complaint would be that Mari is a little too bright and cheery sounding sometimes, which I could see getting on people&#039;s nerves. I didn&#039;t even mind Hanamaru and her continuing to say &#039;zura&#039; after nearly every line. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a fair bit of songs performed and while they all kind of mesh into one if you&#039;re not huge on that music scene, they all sounded really good and had a toe tapping beat. They might not have been memorable by themselves, but they also weren&#039;t &#039;oh dear god make it stop&#039; bad either. <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The show shines in the characters as they are more fleshed out through this season. We see less &#039;movement&#039; or growth, such as Mari&#039;s slapping Kanan in season 1, or Dia&#039;s whole overall attitude. But what we do see is that the girls hold very firm to the personas they presented in the first season. As I said there is a little growth, such as Dia softening a little, but for the most part we get the girls as they are, and their character traits seem to be far more solid than last season. They&#039;ve all found their place and niche, and work all the better for it. <br />
<br />
Each girl seems to get a good deal of screen time, and I didn&#039;t ever feel like they were leaving a girl out in the cold. Muse sometimes made me think the freshmen (shy girl and cat girl) were kind of skipped over, but Sunshine!! doesn&#039;t feature that. Every girl has their own well defined motivation, their defined personalities, and a stable overall interaction between all of them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I found that I liked season 2 better than season one, even though there are some somber moments to be had, especially towards the end of the series. Because of the results of season 1&#039;s actions, I felt there was no guarantee on exactly what the girls were going to achieve, which helped pique my interest instead of just watching the girls sit back and basically conquer the world. The tension that maybe, just maybe, they wouldn&#039;t make all their goals held my attention. <br />
<br />
The ending episode is pretty grand, and I really enjoyed it. It did well in wrapping up everyone&#039;s storyline in relation to the events of the show, and gives the emotional release that I enjoy. And I&#039;m hard to please with endings!<br />
<br />
Best Girl: Yoshiko a.k.a &#039;Yohane&#039; once again. She&#039;s still up to her antics and silliness, though there are moments even she is scared, frustrated or upset. She&#039;s still hilarious though, and I love her for it. <br />
<br />
I had a great time with the entire Love Live! series, so if you are into idol anime at all, then I think not only is Sunshine!! season 2 great, but the entire series is worth watching. Love Live! outclasses in many ways other shows such as the Idolmaster series, and comes close to standing equal to K-On, though I&#039;d say K-On is less idol, more slice of life. Either way, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a great idol anime, and a lot of fun. Come, descend with me my little demons and watch this series!

    This show isn&#039;t for everyone. If you are annoyed by cheesy moments, lots of emotional and melodramatic moments, your probably not gonna like the show. But for me, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Sure it&#039;s cheesy, but it&#039;s overflowing with charm.<br />
<br />
Story: Story is pretty ok. I really didn&#039;t like the &quot;saving the school&quot; plot of the last season but this season actually made it me care more about it without having the plot take up almost every episode. A step in the right direction but I still would&#039;ve preferred it not be so plot-heavy<br />
<br />
Art: The normal 2D art is acceptable but the CG has really made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266903">
        steps forward. The performances look great and a lot less distractingly cheap compared to LL: SIF<br />
<br />
Sound: This is completely subjective but I really love Aqours&#039; music. Like last time, every couple of episodes has an insert song and I really liked all of them. I definitely recommend the show to people who like their music if you haven&#039;t seen it already. The actual OST in the background is ok too.<br />
<br />
Character: Characters get more moments and when they do, the show really shines. The best episodes in my opinion is when they focus on one or two characters with little plot, just letting them all do their thing. Though one issue I have that might annoy people is that sometimes when characters aren&#039;t in the spotlight they kind of resort to using their catchphrases a lot. It&#039;s like the writers wanted to recreate the success of nico nico nii but overdid it by a longshot. Also, some characters don&#039;t get as much screentime as others like You and Kanan.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show is really flawed but something about it is really charming and light-hearted. I feel like the people I&#039;d most recommend this to are people who like Slice of Life, definitely people who like idol and musical shows, and people who liked the original Love Live! (though which one they like better is up to the individual, I personally enjoyed this more despite the flaws). Watch Season 1 before this, its pretty good and it, and the show in general seemed to get better as it went on. This show is still going in my favs because, I&#039;m biased to liking the music, and it definitely made me feel something in the end and get me really attached to the characters despite the flaws. Hoping the movie delivers.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Yoshiko is best girl, puppet show is best episode in the whole franchise, Love Live memes are top tier, and enjoy idol hell!

    I want to write my impressions of Love Live Sunshine!! season 2 but don&#039;t feel like I have that much to say so I will just list what is on my mind.<br />
<br />
In season one the characters, while enjoyable, felt like they relied too much on their gimmicks and would fall apart in a longer series. This season address that concern and actualizes many of the characters that felt too gimmicky, especially Ruby and Dia whose relationship is focused on in a later episode. Basically the gimmicks are already established, and still used, but this season spends more time making each girl feel like a real

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268371">
        person, which is nice.<br />
<br />
There was a great improvement in the musical performances in this season compared to the first with very good looking cg dances that were choreographed quite well. I particularly liked Miracle Wave which is performed at the end of episode 6. I don&#039;t know if they are using completely different software or if they just got better at the technique but all of the cg in the dances looks noticeably better.<br />
<br />
The overall positive, emotional and passionate feel of Love Live Sunshine!! driven by Chika&#039;s desire to shine is carried by the entire cast of girls in this season so it feels motivating to watch. This season feels like the goal is for Aqours to make their mark on the world and to share their community, who throughout the seasons supports them in their performances for the Love Love. It&#039;s actually really endearing to se all fo the Uranohoshi girls supporting Aqours along with the girl&#039;s families.<br />
<br />
Lastly, setting aside the seriousness this season continues to deliver on what I believe Sunshine season one did even better than the original Love Live, and that is having the girls engage in cute meaningless nonsense with all of their silly personalities. I think that is what Love Live as a series does best and it&#039;s always enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
If you liked any of Love Live I would highly recommend going ahead and watching this season as it may be my favorite of all of them.

    SPOILER FREE<br />
<br />
That was the Rubesty, Zura!<br />
<br />
Really though, Love Live Sunshine! has been really good. I&#039;ll be the first to say that the original grasped me more (as I&#039;m a HUGE fan), but this was still amazing nonetheless! Love Live Sunshine has been a treat, full of smiles, songs as good as the original and improved CGI.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Love Live fan watch this season for sure, if you haven&#039;t seen it before, be sure to watch the original first i&#039;d say (but this isn&#039;t a bad start either).<br />
<br />
Won&#039;t bore you anymore with my fan-girling, now for the more analytic stuff;<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
Originally this score was lower

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267338">
        because it seemed as though the plot was a carbon copy of the original. Then the added a slight twist (that I won&#039;t reveal to keep it spoiler free) that still had the similarities in the plots being more than the differences. But what won me over wasn&#039;t these little differences, it was the more meaningful interactions (such as with other idol groups) in the story that built on the plot.<br />
Sure the plot is similar to the first series, but that&#039;s hard to avoid when the whole basis is of &quot;school girls becoming idols and trying to win love live&quot;. Slightly repetitive at this but a fun, and surprisingly emotional, story, that improved a lot from season 1 to season 2.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
THE CGI LOOKS GREAT! Really happy to see these improvements as it now makes the performance scenes tonnes more enjoyable. Nice and easy on the eye, can&#039;t complain really.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be the first to say that some of the songs in season 2 have topped those of the previous season and the original. Aqours have great voices and the songs they sing all come together really well. Not quite Snow Halation good, but great in there own right.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
<br />
So the approach taken was, of course, to make characters that somewhat resemble someone from the original Love Live series. This approach was pretty weak in the first season as it felt like redoing what had been done. However this season, during the character development episodes we see our characters grow to be unique. These episodes really saved the day for these characters, making them more lovable and personal.<br />
What really won me over however is the interactions between characters. The clear bond between the girls in each year. It really was pleasant seeing Kanan treat Mari like a princess, or Hanamaru and Ruby bonding (or just seeing Hanamaru is general). <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
When watching this season, I didn&#039;t sit and binge like I do many other anime series. Instead I&#039;d watch a couple at a time, saving the smiles and purity of Love Live for when I needed it. This season will make you laugh, smile and maybe even cry ( I know I did once). Could, and will, happily watch this season again in the future. <br />
Only reason it isn&#039;t a 10 is because it didn&#039;t have that wow factor that glues your eyes to the screen.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.5<br />
<br />
How sad that I can&#039;t give this a higher score.. but it&#039;s just not the same. That said Love Live Sunshine! season 2 is another great season, with really pleasant episodes for the individual characters. The characters&#039; growth as individuals, and as a group, sure makes it things enjoyable and helps make the plot shine.<br />
Love Live Sunshine! found it&#039;s radiance from my perspective and I would recommend watching this season to the end.<br />

    “You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that&#039;s where you&#039;ll find the things more important than what you want.”<br />
<br />
-Yoshihiro Togashi, Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 32<br />
<br />
To bear dignity in defeat is a common mark of maturity, of respect. But to wholeheartedly accept that defeat, internalizing all of the lessons and experiencing of it, using it as a catalyst for a leap forward into your prospective future? <br />
<br />
That&#039;s an entire level entirely, and that theme is heavily explored throughout every episode of Sunshine&#039;s 2nd season run. <br />
<br />
As opposed to the first season, I felt that this season was less about Aqours finding themselves or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302599">
        working to become their very best, the entire season instead felt much more introspective, like a rebuild of efforts lost. <br />
<br />
More importantly, the season really focused on how Chika and crew took every loss along the way, and turned it into a positive force. <br />
<br />
Just like in season 1, it&#039;s heartbreaking to see their efforts go completely to waste. They completely failed to even come close to winning Love Live in the last season, and in this season, it&#039;s revealed from the first few episodes that their main goal in becoming idols in the first place isn&#039;t going to become a reality.<br />
<br />
To put it simply, Aqours lost. <br />
<br />
In contrast to Muse, I&#039;ve commented that the starkest difference is that a big focus is put on how much Aqours grinds out of the ditch with their efforts. They struggle, they suffer, they grind harder than any of the girls in Muse do in those first two seasons. <br />
<br />
So to see all of those efforts flushed down the toilet should be completely devastating, reflecting the first time they encounter defeat in the first season.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s where the season won for me. Despite some imbalance of its characterizations, its over the top humor (it goes full slapstick at some points, much worse than any of the previous seasons), and its heavier moments, this second season absolutely triumphs in its manifestation of its themes. <br />
<br />
Of moving forward, no matter what, of lifting your head up no matter how much life just takes a FAT shit on you, of fighting towards your &quot;shine&quot; after you&#039;re crushed by darkness, after realizing you don&#039;t even KNOW what your &quot;shine&quot; is.<br />
<br />
Despite its flaws, the season won me over with just how earnest it is in its delivery of its broad, larger than life strokes. It&#039;s not an approach that many can appreciate, and I can see why. <br />
<br />
Characterization at some points is less refined and comparatively dull to the first season, and yes, pales in comparison to the seasons of the original seasons. But to that I counter that the growth and characterization of the group as a WHOLE is unrivaled. I did not expect things to turn out this way, for all of Aqours efforts to have been for nothing.<br />
<br />
But as Chika realizes in the end of the show, was it all for nothing? Or were the experiences and relationships she forged along the way the true &quot;shine&quot; she set forward to find in the first place? <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a very basic theme, sure, but Love Live has a surefire way of encapsulating larger than life themes, and injecting pure wholesome passion into my veins like nothing else, and for that, Sunshine triumphs.

    Aight. I&#039;ll be a wee bit spoiler-y so, warning given. Might not be too long as I may forget some things, but here we go.<br />
<br />
So, Love Live Sunshine... *sigh* Okay, let&#039;s see. This series got very... boring for me after Aqours&#039; Love Live regional qualifiers performance. Like that shit was lit and I was anxious to see it. But after that it just, fell off. Things got a bit too repetitive, cheesy, corny, cringe worthy, laughable even. But I shall break that down as best I can. <br />
<br />
1. The characters. I like how different most of the cast were in this version. Mind a couple,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339931">
        i.e Chika who I shall start with. She is just as bubbly, slightly ditsy and full of spunk as the character from the OG I always find myself comparing her to: Honoka. And guess what? Honoka is better. At least imo. BUT, I also found myself being a bit fond of Chika due to how energetic and optimistic she is. Had me callin&#039; her name in a fond manner sometimes with a smile on my face. I loved how she was the pivot, the voice of reason in a lot of scenes and the motivation. There could be doubts voiced among the group, which would be dispelled the moment she opened her mouth. Again same as Honoka, but still admirable. Maybe it is bad of me to compare them, but I can&#039;t help it as they are so similar, you see. And so, just like Honoka, Chika had a time when she doubted herself and didn&#039;t know what to be doing. A bit of, what&#039;s it called.. trouble finding herself? I think. She didn&#039;t see her own merits for what they were and needed to be told by the members of Aqours. Of course she overcomes this and shines again. I call her Honoka 2.0.<br />
Ruby was just, Ruby. Cute, sometimes makes you laugh. Her little word became a favorite of mine. &quot;Rubesty&quot;. But I did like the fact they gave her a mini arc of her own, with that Saint Snow girl. It was sweet they came together and made a song. But that also threw me off, I thought they were gonna do a duet the whole time. And the opening choreography, with those camera angles and tilts were fantastic. Lead me to think it was, but then the rest of the group joined in(I wanted it to be a duet okay) and I was slightly put off but got over it. <br />
You, for me, was also just there. But I liked her quirks, the whole ship girl kinda theme. She had a little episode where she was having trouble and wondering if she is special to Chika anymore. Which she should have been, because in the beginning it was just the two of them. You was trying to help Chika before she even made up her mind to join her. But then, she became more like a side character. <br />
Which brings me to Riko. She ended up standing out more than You, and essentially became Chika&#039;s new bestie. Her character is likable, having back and forth moments with Yohane that made you laugh at times. And she had her own little episode arc where she overcame her fear of dogs. That ep was very wholesome and worth the watch.<br />
Yohane. Now, for me she made no impact whatsoever. I liked her little shtick but it gets meh pretty fast because she does not grow out of it. Which is good in it&#039;s own way. She was told to be herself after all, but that&#039;s about it. I&#039;d say Rikka Takanashi has much better Chuunibyou thingoes going on. <br />
Hannamaru is one of my favs. She starts out pretty quiet but slowly becomes more and more of an attention grabber for me. Her verbal tick never gets old. And her sass is amusing. Though what made me wonder is how she could eat almost like a glutton and her performances are never affected. (when in contrast there was a whole episode dedicated to Honoka and a weight crisis in the OG)<br />
Kanan is next. I should say I love her name for some reason. Has this ring to it, and rolls off the tongue nicely. I liked her mature presence in the series, I suppose. She&#039;s cute and had her own little arc as well. (tryna keep it short also, but I&#039;m about to splurge.)<br />
<br />
-Dia. There are many things I like about her. For one thing she is my second favorite out of the whole cast. I love her refined character, her maturity, stern demeanor, phrase(boop boop version in English). And to top it off she&#039;s a great big sister and has her own cute side. Her episode arc treated us to that side, where she had a desire to be close to the other members, and some growth of course. Not to mention she is gorgeous. I like how her mole was inspired by her VA which has one in the same area. <br />
-Lastly, Mari. She is my #1 fav after Dia, I love her energy, her unique personality, her charisma, the way she speaks, and the charm. There was almost never a dull moment when she was on screen. She has some Nozomi tendencies as there were a couple times she would get touchy with Kanan or Dia, just shits and giggles tbh. I also admired the fact that, while Mari is a rich girl, you only stay aware of this when the series itself reminds you--which is not often at all. <br />
<br />
2. Settings and structure/elements. I like how the school isn&#039;t as popular or in a larger area like Tokyo. It was a beautiful place with a view of Mt. Fuji in the distance. But we are not confined to this town. The girls go all over in some episodes and move about often, keeping things fresh. I don&#039;t like the absence of males in this series, I can&#039;t avoid that. I get the idea, but it was done in SIP and they brought it back here. But at least in SIP Honoka&#039;s dad became one of the sweet/comedic elements of the series. Man had more presence than some of the other school girls despite the fact we never see all of his face or hear him talk. I mean he would be seen crying at more than one of Muse&#039;s performances because he&#039;s watching his beloved daughter do what she does best, getting to see her shine and give her all. But in Sunshine, there&#039;s literally only one scene where we see Chika&#039;s father and he did nothing. We also only see just the upper lip down of Mari&#039;s father just for a single flashback, he also did nothing. And while he and Mari had several conversations on phone during S2, that&#039;s not even important. I get it, it&#039;s a shoujou but wouldn&#039;t the fathers of some of the characters be great motivators? Not just the women, ya know? But anyway. The Saint Snow girls were a decent addition to the series. When they first popped up, it made you wonder about them. Will they be the greatest rivals to Aqours like A-Rise was to Muse? Nah, not really, they ain&#039;t shite compared to A-Rise. They were just kinda hyped up like a shounen antagonist that eventually slipped into the position of minor place holder in the series. (save the whole Ruby arc). I can say I loved all the little pokes and references to Muse in the first season. It made me feel nostalgia despite I just finished SIP not long before this. Made me miss them. But I was conflicted as these girls were trying to follow in the footsteps of Muse. Thankfully they changed this after a very strong wake up call, and Aqours began to form their own path. Especially after that episode with some close representations, Chika catching a feather. But that brings me to the issue I found in S2. Shit gets repetitive. It started slow, some fluffy stuff here and there but it got more and more there and all but thrown at you. What I am talking about is the whole friendship values and this constant search of radiance. It was fine at first but slowly this series turned into the Fairy Tail of idol anime. We almost never go an episode without them pepping themselves up with friendship and radiance speeches. The biggest example is when Chika was trying to learn a new, dangerous move that they wanted her to do in their upcoming Love Live performance. I believe it was the qualifying stage for who would advance to Love Live itself. You see, Chika was having a lot of issues learning this move. Like she fell on her behind over and over and got minor cuts during this practice period, (they do treat us to damage progression as band-aids popped up every other scene rather than just two and calling it a day). It seemed hopeless, and Kanan gave her a stipulation which went: if she could not learn the move by dawn on the day of their performance she had to give up. So... guess how she finally pulled it off? Yep. Friendship no jutsu. Said performance was pretty cool I will admit but this big move, which was spent a whole episode on, was finally shown to us in a very poor manner. Anyway, uhh. Oh there was a certain scene where these chicks, driven by Mari in a hippie van all of a sudden took off into the air. *tossed his glasses, holding up his arms* Listen, don&#039;t do drugs, kids. I haven&#039;t the foggiest why this was done, I got the premise but... yeah.<br />
<br />
3. Music. As I have mentioned here and there, performances were pretty good. But some stand out. Such as their Chinese themed performance, that one for Christmas. And there was another, they did it at a stadium? It was right when some of their schoolmates wanted to join them on stage. But none hit me like Todokete from the OG. The inner soundtrack is not bad, but for me it&#039;s nothing special as I have heard so many that were just amazing. I will say the opening of S2 here is pretty high up there. But I mostly like the first eight seconds and some other bits after the middle part. <br />
<br />
*he&#039;d carefully put in the last piece of a 3k piece puzzle while also solving several rubix cubes*<br />
<br />
So basically what I&#039;m saying here is, I prefer the OG. But, this series still has it&#039;s goods. I feel they sort of put themselves in a tough spot given the fact it was already done in SIP. But I heard there will be another installment, wonder how that&#039;ll be. Anyhoo, I think that is all I have to say, hope I wasn&#039;t too awful. <br />

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
Each sunrise brings sunshine. But, eventually, that sunshine must give way to a sunset.<br />
<br />
The same similarly goes for Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season, a metaphorical sunset for the school-idol group Aquors and their hard-fought journey. While it does not sing nearly as loudly or as proudly as its prequel, a few rays of hope sneak in nonetheless.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Sunshine 2 (as it will be nicknamed from here on out) picks up almost right after Sunshine 1. The group still has its sights set on saving their school, banding together anew to tackle the Love Live gauntlet again.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295462">
        Not as separate ladies but as a unified unit with a more-than-zero mentality.<br />
<br />
Having addressed its predecessor and its influence – in a thematic sense no less – within the prior season, this season attempts to carve a name out for itself and nobody else. Indeed, mentions, references, or allusions to the famous Greek-lettered group are practically non-existent (if not missing entirely). In doing so, the show breaks away from that looming glare of “they aren’t like them” and moves towards a proper stance of “they aren’t like them.”<br />
<br />
This subtle difference appears as Sunshine 2 basks in slice-of-life goodness. Several episodes aim to highlight the quirks and the challenges of the girls in a less dramatic manner, such as episode four with Dia wanting to grow closer with the younger members or episode five with the doggy dispute between Yoshino and Riko.<br />
<br />
Not that the series has never had its fair share of this type of content. However, these events align much more with exploring these characters and their situations rather than going for introductions or resemblances (which its first season already did).<br />
<br />
Key to the Love-Live formula, Sunshine 2 also incorporates those team-related aspects. They collaborate to write songs. They stick with each other during melancholic happenings. They go on a road trip that solidifies their fortitude (and defies the laws of physics). Chika, Riko, You, Yoshiko, Hanamaru, Ruby, Kanan, Dia, and Mari may be a bunch of individuals, but, when together as one, this season proves they are Aquors first and foremost.<br />
<br />
This last season also champions the same atmosphere, making sure not to lose sight of its Love Live origins outright. The mood of the anime maintains that comedic angle as always, and the ultra-optimism in-between, while maybe overbearing at times, continues to lend itself well to an uplifting experience.<br />
<br />
But the narrative overall is a downgrade. Where their beginning is mired with loss and difficulty, their ending here stands in stark contrast as a meteoric rise to the top ensues. Granted, the Love Live spectacle itself isn’t really the point of the story being told, especially in this instance where it represents a spiritual win for all involved. Still, a weakened thematic presence and this missing drama reduces impact in the story.<br />
<br />
Sunshine 2 tries to make up for that easier rise with its increased focus on the threat of the school closing, but it doesn’t always come through. This dilemma can sometimes get lost amidst its other interpersonal scenes, and their vehement need to keep it around isn’t exactly quantified or justified besides the notion of memories and attachment. Traits the audience do not see much of let alone can relate to.<br />
<br />
To its credit, though, the bittersweet direction is interesting, both because of this franchise’s inherent optimism and because it once again chooses to move away from those that came before it. Thus, despite those narrative troubles, Aquors’s journey concludes in solid-enough fashion.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
The interim between this season and the previous season is negligible, so the artistic vision for this next iteration remains practically the same. So, to keep it short and sweet, this sameness is a welcome return to likable form.<br />
<br />
The proof is in the performance. For instance, the character designs remain collectively cute yet individually distinct among the lot. Their musical attire takes on a colorful and charismatic look per usual. Choreography for their dances is still easy to follow (CG or otherwise). Increased actual animation highlight the fun in their actions. Expressions contort into hilarious responses.<br />
<br />
Sunshine 2 fails to have its settings and backgrounds reach the same level as these other visual elements, but that’s perhaps expected since (to reiterate) the artistic direction has been carried over into this sequel season. That also means that it reaches the same level of strength as before, so it’s certainly not a major problem.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
In Sunshine 1, establishing the characters meant exploring their reasons and their struggles before joining on as an official member. Here in Sunshine 2, the anime explores other conflicts surrounding the ladies, but it also has a much tougher time juggling them in conjunction with the plot.<br />
<br />
A few characters certainly have their moments. Ruby receives a large amount of attention as her relationship with Dia, her older sister, becomes a point of contention regarding maturity and “moving on” later in the season. The anime steps it up another level when it draws parallels between them and the sister duo of Saint Snow. And Chika herself earns some time as the prospect of failure challenges her determination and her resolve (in flip-like motion) not only for the sake of the rest of Aquors but also for her own sake, too.<br />
<br />
Yet some characters seem woefully left out: Hanamaru, You, and Mari come to mind first. Phrasing it obtusely, they’re there but not there. Hanamaru seems reserved for comedic relief only. You sticks with mostly a supportive role. And Mari exists as the arbiter of the closing school and not much else. Arguably speaking, these characters had their problems already taken care of in Sunshine 1, but so did everyone, so it feels odd to leave a sizable chunk of the cast on the sidelines.<br />
<br />
Sunshine 2 gets back on track when it enlarges the scope from their singular characters to the intrateam dynamic. For example, third-years Mari, Kanan, and Dia (Dia, as can be gleaned from this analysis, appears to be around the most) acknowledge their separation after graduation but likewise know that, at least in their hearts, they’ll be together forever.<br />
<br />
More generally, they rally around each other as a group, solidifying their camaraderie as their shared reams become a reality. It happens a lot. Back in episode three, they initially split up to take care of two back-to-back events but eventually realize that their strength derives from their collective. Even the smaller pillow-fight scene before the big night in episode twelve helps to highlight the friendships they have fostered over the course of their whole adventure.<br />
<br />
Yet other dynamics hit speedbumps as well. Chika and Riko’s relationship, despite being so vital in the first season, fizzles out to some extent. And, despite being around one another for so long now, the ladies rarely cross party lines, sticking with their year’s internal group for the most part rather than crossing over, missing out on jokes and possible bonds as a result.<br />
<br />
In the end, Sunshine 2 simply doesn’t have as much to say about Aquors. Be it because of the strife they already went through last season or this season’s failure to really include everyone in the festivities, it leaves the nine girls in a precarious position.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
Per usual, the various parts of the audio within a music-centric anime like Sunshine 2 are held to a slightly higher standard. Unfortunately, this season succumbs to a middling rendition once again.<br />
<br />
The opening track, “Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo”, has a similarly grand feel as last time, using bells, drums, pianos, and other brass instruments. But the first half or so of the song misses out on catchiness and intrigue as the buildup meanders. However, the second half swoops in with tons of passion as the vocals soar with that mandatory optimism.<br />
<br />
As for “Yuuki wa Doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!”, this new ending track follows suit as well in a negative fashion. It’s an okay track with more of a fantastical feel, a neat little lyrical “reverb” part near the end, and many different takes done by different members of the cast. Sadly, though, okay just doesn’t cut it.<br />
<br />
Especially so when the insert songs of Sunshine 2, at least a couple of them, demonstrate maturity and prowess in both the song writing and the musicality. A special shout-out goes to one such song: “Awaken the power”. While ironically not an exclusively Aquors song, it stands as one of the best the whole franchise has put together thanks to its changes in pacing, instrumentation, and vocal delivery.<br />
<br />
Moving on, the original soundtrack also starts to grow on the listener. It was already pretty swell, but its main motif and poignant arrangement, found throughout several tracks, elicits even more emotion, either because the series is coming to a close itself or it has been lightly patting the audience on the back for the past twelve (twenty-four in total) episodes now.<br />
<br />
And the voice-acting performances remain passable in execution. The women behind Aquors sound more comfortable in their roles when compared to the first season, and their experience in talking and singing moves ahead a bit. Again, while nothing special, their relative newbie status and their commitment to these quirky personalities deserves some props within Sunshine 2 for sure.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
I greatly liked the first season, so I selfishly expected the same here. It didn’t quite reach that same level of entertainment, but I can’t lie and say I didn’t find myself laughing or smiling or cheering during its run.<br />
<br />
My favorite characters Yoshiko and Hanamaru were in full force with their silliness and their reactions. Sometimes they would team up for duo hilarity, and I liked them all the better for it. Kanan, one of my other favorites, wasn’t as prominent, but her “hug” line as she got scared of the dark was too cute to forget.<br />
<br />
Of course, I still liked the rest of the cast as well. Riko dealing with her fears. Ruby and her “Rubesty!” catchphrase. Mari’s frequent English usage. You with her saluting as always. And Chika leading with happiness aplenty. Maybe oversaturation occurs with their signature jokes, such as Dia’s “wrong-answer” buzzing and definitely Yoshiko’s “It’s Yohane!” response. Nonetheless, they were all once again a likable troupe of idols who not only tried to the best of their ability but also created a heartwarming environment whatever they happened to be doing.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the performances were often a spectacle as always. The meanings behind them and the concert-esque structure. So many colors and formations. So much winking and hand flourishing. Emotions for days. I’m a huge metalhead (e.g., black metal, death metal, and each subgenre therein), but I found myself grabbed by their setpieces for the last time.<br />
<br />
And so, this chapter of the franchise concludes (save for whatever other films and song-releases they have on the horizon; announced or otherwise). It hasn’t been the most perfect or sensational follow-up to a beloved series, but this second season – and indeed this entire second iteration – has been a respectable outing regardless. I look forward to seeing where the (inevitable?) third iteration goes next.<br />
<br />
Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season waves goodbye to Aquors but gives them a solid farewell tribute in the process. While most aspects of this season do not live up to the previous prequel, its unconventional plot direction, its nice production values, and its strong sense of entertainment make up for some of the woes in its character writing. But no worries. There’s always another sunrise right around the corner.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, a bittersweet ending, slice-of-life segments, and the focus on group activities compete against missing narrative nuance and weak drama<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Good, following the footsteps of its immediate ancestor, the visuals alight with cool choreography for the dances, noticeable movement, and cute designs<br />
<br />
Characters: Bad, while specific characters and dynamics vouch for some of the ladies, the cast members have a hard time either being relevant or establishing relationships for most of this finale<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Fine, the OP and the ED are another step down when compared to before, but the insert songs, the OST, and the VA performances do not go the same way without a fight<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Good, hilarious still, engaging in its routines, and a respectable sendoff of this second tale<br />
<br />
Final Score: 5/10
